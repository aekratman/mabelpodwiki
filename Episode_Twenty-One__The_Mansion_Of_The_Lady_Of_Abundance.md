#### **Trigger Warnings** {#trigger_warnings}

- Screaming, distortion, fire, captivity.

## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Mabel escapes into the garden after burning down the house, speaking
about herself and Anna. She hears static and distortion before hearing
Anna say her very first line\-- \"I\'m going into the ground for you\".
She goes to chase down the voice and the House starts screaming her
name; she runs away and continues to talk to Anna.

She falls asleep at some point and wakes up with her hair tied up with a
rope. She can\'t cut it away, so she follows it to the end of the
string, which is tied to an oak tree that has a hollow within it. Mabel,
hoping to find Anna, steps inside, and finds Anna\'s voicemail echoing
within.

The last thing we hear before the episode cuts off is Anna\'s
doppleganger\-- the person who trapped Mabel\-- telling her hello.

- The labyrinth motif continues due to the \'thread\' in Mabel\'s hair,
  leading Anna\'s doppleganger to be positioned as both Theseus and the
  Minotaur.
- Mabel being tied around an oak tree is similar to Vera\'s later line
  about being made of very sturdy, good quality oak.
