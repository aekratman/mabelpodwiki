a promise.</p>

girl-ouroboros. </p>
<h2 id="episode_overview">Episode Overview</h2>
<p>Voicemails by the dozen.</p>
<h4 id="trigger_warnings"><strong>Trigger Warnings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Death, suicide mentions, gun violence, gore, unreality,
distortion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="episode_summary">Episode Summary</h2>
<p>This entire episode contains monologues of various characters talking
to <a href="Mabel_Martin" class="wikilink" title="Mabel Martin">Mabel
Martin</a>.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="Aurora_Silver" class="wikilink"
title="Aurora Silver">Aurora Silver</a>. She says that she does not play
favorites among the children she is around, and that she in fact
dislikes children strongly, but that there is something strange about
Mabel. She wonders why Mabel is special. She then states that she wishes
to find out Mabel's secrets and will scoop them out of Mabel's skull if
she has to.</p>
<p>The second is <a href="Eidolon_García" class="wikilink"
title="Eidolon García">Eidolon García</a>. She talks about a spirit she
saw outside her mother's house when she was twelve years old. The
spirit, a teenage boy continuously shooting himself, was horrified when
Lolo tried to save him. Lolo realized that being stuck in a loop of his
death was his "heaven", and he felt that he did something meaningful by
dying. Lolo then says that she was caught up in what she stood for--
trying to save him-- without realizing she was hurting him in the
process. She tells Mabel that she's trying to remember that Mabel is
someone Anna loves, even though Lolo is scared that Mabel represents a
bringing of chaos Lolo says she can't stop herself from "hoping that
maybe--" before the narrative cuts her off.</p>
<p>The third is <a href="The_Emissary" class="wikilink"
title="The Emissary">The Emissary</a>. He talks about seeing a star fall
and the entire world changing due to it; he tells Mabel that the King
feels "a certain way" about her, and that she is his blind spot, which
is dangerous due to the King's entropic state. The Emissary says he has
nothing against Mabel and calls her "little star", linking her to the
catastrophe he spoke about earlier.</p>
<p>The fourth is <a href="Veratrine" class="wikilink"
title="Veratrine">Veratrine</a>. Vera says she's jealous of Mabel
because of how "[Vera's] image" (presumably Anna) looks at Mabel.
Veratrine is jealous because she cannot get emotions to settle onto her
face like they do on Anna's. Vera says she knows she should tell Luna
what Mabel had said (see[ A
Superfluity](Episode_Forty-One:_A_Superfluity ” A
Superfluity”){.wikilink}), but she won't, because she doesn't know
whatever it is Mabel does. Vera says she's afraid of what Mabel means
and what it will bring to herself and Luna; that Mabel is like a black
hole, and that might have been what the King had always saw in her.</p>
<p>The fifth is <a href="Janet_Kirk" class="wikilink"
title="Janet Kirk">Janet Kirk</a>. She talks about her insecurities,
saying that though she's been ghost hunting, she's always worried that
she didn't matter enough for the spirits she searched for to try to put
on a good show for her. She explains that now, going back to the Martin
House, is the first time she feels that what she's doing matters. She
says that both Mabel and Lolo are "larger than life" and important, and
that she isn't, but she feels going to find Mabel is the most important
thing she's ever done. Janet thanks Mabel for helping her "do something
right" and says she has a good feeling about what they're going to
do.</p>
<p>The sixth is <a href="The_House" class="wikilink"
title="The House">The House</a>, which plays scratchy recordings of old
songs. The lyrics played are as follows: <em>lonely, lonely as can be /
for I want you only [STATIC] want you only [STATIC] you only--</em> and
<em>home, just like before / roam never no more / no place like home
[STATIC] home [STATIC] home--</em></p>
<p>The seventh is <a href="Anna_Limón" class="wikilink"
title="Anna Limón">Anna Limón</a>, She tells Mabel that she questions
her memories sometimes, and isn't sure how she grew up. She talks for a
bit about keeping a notebook about the good things that happened to her
when she was a kid, and how she never thought to keep a notebook of her
and Mabel's time together, as she never thought they'd be apart. She
says she remembers every part of her time with Mabel and it doesn't
matter if she isn't physically with her: there's no "unwriting what
[they've] made." She explains that herself, Lolo, Janet, and (possibly)
the Emissary will be driving back to the House soon; she'll be getting
back to Mabel soon, and promises to find her if it "kills her all over
[again].".<br />

<ul>
<li>"Girl-ouroboros" is one of Mabel's nicknames/titles. She is first
called this by a faery in <a href="Episode_Twenty-Six:_Danse_Macabre"
class="wikilink" title="Danse Macabre">Danse Macabre</a>; Anna mentions
the nickname in <a href="Episode_Forty-Four:_Ashes,_Ashes"
class="wikilink" title="Ashes, Ashes">Ashes, Ashes</a>.</li>
<li>Aurora Silver asks Mabel what makes her special; Jonathan questions
a similar thing during his final monologue in <a
href="Episode_Forty-Four:_Ashes,_Ashes" class="wikilink"
title="Ashes, Ashes">Ashes, Ashes</a>. She also says there is something
special about Mabel in her first ever monologue during the beginning of
<a href="Episode_Twenty-Nine:_Aurora_Silver_is_Willing_to_Wait"
class="wikilink" title="Aurora Silver is Willing to Wait">Aurora Silver
is Willing to Wait</a>.</li>
<li>The spirit Lolo watches die is presumably <a href="Brandon"
class="wikilink" title="Brandon">Brandon</a>, the teenage boy who shot
himself in <a href="Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake" class="wikilink"
title="Temporal Snake">Temporal Snake</a> in order to do something that
matters to the world around him (see <a
href="https://mabelpodcast.tumblr.com/post/633693856272105472/do-you-have-any-random-details-about-brandon-from">this</a>
tumblr post).
<ul>
<li>The repetitive loop Lolo mentions can also be linked to <a
href="Thomas" class="wikilink" title="Thomas">Thomas</a>'s ultimate
fate.</li>
<li>In <a href="Episode_Fifteen:_Killing_the_Moon" class="wikilink"
title="Killing the Moon,">Killing the Moon,</a> Mabel says that she
thought "the worst thing in the world was repetition".</li>
<li>In <a href="Episode_Thirty-One:_The_King_Speaks" class="wikilink"
title="The King Speaks">The King Speaks</a>, the King says that "There
are no endings, only repetition."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Emissary then refers to the King's force of entropy as having no
ending-- make of that what you will.</li>
<li>The Emissary also says Mabel has a lovely voice, and that previously
that was all that would have mattered. Mabel once told Anna that the
Hill would make her "sing for [her] supper" (see (<a
href="Episode_Seventeen:_Orientation" class="wikilink"
title="Orientation">Orientation</a>).</li>
<li>Veratrine says watching Anna is like watching a mirror "if your
reflection didn’t care at all about what you wanted." Mabel's reflection
is Luna Thorne, who is exactly that.</li>
<li>Vera calls Mabel a black hole. In <a
href="Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake" class="wikilink"
title="Temporal Snake">Temporal Snake</a>, Mabel says that Aurora Silver
is as incomprehensibly dense as a black hole. In <a
href="Episode_Thirty-Nine:_Reverie" class="wikilink"
title="Reverie">Reverie</a>, Mabel refers to the Martin House as a black
hole.</li>
<li>Anna references motherhood several times through her monologue,
which is an overarching motif in the show.</li>
<li>Anna says she remembers everything about her time with Mabel. In <a
href="Episode_Thirty:_The_Consort" class="wikilink"
title="The Consort">The Consort</a>, Mabel says that she remembers
everything Anna says: "All of it. Every single word."</li>
<li>Anna calls the House both hers and <a href="Sally_Martin"
class="wikilink" title="Sally">Sally</a>'s, which has happened several
times throughout the show.</li>
<li>Anna says she'd tied her thread around Mabel's wrist; this
references Anna being the ball of thread in the <a
href="Crete_Hierarchy" class="wikilink" title="Crete Hierarchy">Crete
Hierarchy</a>.</li>
<li>In <a href="Episode_Sixteen:_Underworld" class="wikilink"
title="Underworld">Underworld</a>, Anna is referred to as "a gift tied
in ribbon." She also says "Didn’t I say I’d come after you, hand over
hand, fist over fist, into the rot of the black earth, into the
labyrinth?" This ties to her saying "I can make my way, hand over hand,
to you" here.</li>
<li>Anna says the King put Mabel in the seed of the universe-- this
could reference the acorn he used as his champion during <a
href="Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake" class="wikilink"
title="Temporal Snake">Temporal Snake</a>. Anna also refers to herself
as a seed several times, and drinks a poison involving seeds to die in
<a href="Episode_Fourteen:_Legacy" class="wikilink"
title="Legacy">Legacy</a>. Mabel says she has planted seeds of herself
everywhere in <a href="Episode_Twenty-Eight:_Matryoshka"
class="wikilink" title="Matryoshka">Matryoshka</a>.</li>
<li>Anna says the roads to the House are the map of her heart,
referencing the line from <a href="Episode_Eight:_Freeze"
class="wikilink" title="The Freeze">The Freeze</a>: <em>If the house is
a heart, you’re the hook cut through it.</em></li>
</ul>

<li><a href="Maybell_Marten" class="wikilink"
title="Maybell Marten">Maybell Marten</a> reads the introduction to this
episode; in every other episode, <a href="Becca_De_La_Rosa"
class="wikilink" title="Becca De La Rosa">Becca De La Rosa</a> has that
particular honor. Mrs. De La Rosa still reads the end credits.</li>
<li>The "in which" portion of the episode is identical to the one from
the original <a href="Episode_One:_The_Letters" class="wikilink"
title="The Letters">The Letters</a>.</li>
<li>Seeing as the Emissary referred to himself as a bird in <a
href="Episode_Forty-Five:_Daddy_Issues" class="wikilink"
title="Daddy Issues">Daddy Issues</a>, the star he references changing
the entire world could be the meteor which killed the dinosaurs ("oceans
split, earth walked") as birds evolved from dinosaurs.</li>
