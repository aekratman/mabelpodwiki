<p>In which what we consume consumes us. Featuring: a Biblical
plague.</p>
<p><strong>Episode description:</strong> The <a href="The_House"
class="wikilink" title="house">house</a> flexes its muscles, more than
once, and an unhappy <a href="Aconite" class="wikilink"
title="heir">heir</a> demands her inheritance.</p>
<h2 id="episode_overview">Episode Overview</h2>
<p>Many girls meet their deaths.</p>
<h4 id="trigger_warnings"><strong>Trigger Warnings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Screaming, distortion, unreality, pain, injury, arguments, loud
noises, child abuse mentions, starvation, death, corpses, unwilling
transformation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="episode_summary">Episode Summary</h2>
<p>The episode opens with <a href="Mabel_Martin" class="wikilink"
title="Mabel">Mabel</a> (referred to as Subject 7825) being experimented
on, presumably during her time at <a href="El_Segundo_Academy"
class="wikilink" title="El Segundo">El Segundo</a>. Afterwards, we cut
to <a href="Anna_LimÃ³n" class="wikilink" title="Anna">Anna</a> and Mabel
talking about <a href="Brandon" class="wikilink"
title="Brandon">Brandon</a>, assuming he was one of "<a
href="Aurora_Silver" class="wikilink" title="Aurora Silver">Aurora
Silver</a>'s people"; then they discuss the <a href="The_King"
class="wikilink" title="King">King</a>, and that he happened to help
them. Mabel and the House get into a fight, and Mabel screams at Anna
before the House moves both of them to the attic. Mabel begins to have a
mild panic attack, and tries to apologize to Anna; Anna tells her she's
just here to help, and Mabel tells her she's been poisoned before the
House begins to scream.</p>
<p>We cut back to <a href="Janet_Kirk" class="wikilink"
title="Janet">Janet</a>, who explains that after she fell in the leaves
in the previous episode, she felt like she was drowning in the leaves
before the House opened its doors for her; she finds herself in a large
room (possibly the Green Parlor?) which is covered in graffiti,
including a line that says JANET KIRK MEETS HER OWN DEATH.</p>
<p>Back with the Girls, Anna is confused on why there are locusts
everywhere in the attic. The girls get into an argument. We briefly hear
an experiment involving someone called Subject 6163 before hearing from
Aconite, who talks about bugs and burrowing and her dad. She wishes to
devour the kingdom under the ground. Back with the girls, Anna attempts
to leave the attic, but the girls make up from their fight and Mabel
explains some of the abuse she went through in the attic; they discuss
the fact that the House may have eaten Brandon before the House drops
his dead body in front of them, which turns into a snake. Mabel panics
and repeats that "they're coming back to do it again."<br />

<ul>
<li>This is the first time Mabel is referred to as Subject 7825, though
she was revealed to be a former cultist in <a

class="wikilink" title="Aurora Silver is Willing to Wait">Aurora Silver
is Willing to Wait</a>.</li>
<li>Brandon's corpse being turned into a snake (this podcast is <em>so
goddamn weird</em> /affectionate) could be a reference to the tagline of
