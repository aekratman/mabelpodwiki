The black hound. The white hound. The red dove. The blood moon. The
fertile sea. The barren forest. The old crow. The new starling. The king
of the crossroads. The mirror of snakes. The prison of iron---

## Speculation

The hounds more than likely refer to [The
King](The_King "The King"){.wikilink}, as they tend to. The red dove may
refer to the boy [Tressa
Davies](Tressa_Davies "Tressa Davies"){.wikilink} watches die in
[Infinity Mirror](Infinity_Mirror "Infinity Mirror"){.wikilink},
commonly called the \"mourning dove.\" The blood moon seems to reference
a line in [Episode Seven: King in the
Labyrinth](Episode_Seven:_King_in_the_Labyrinth "Episode Seven: King in the Labyrinth"){.wikilink};
\"Have you ever seen a moon so red it makes your blood look white?\" The
fertile sea and barren forest don\'t have apparent canonical
connections. The old crow may also be a reference to the King. The new
starling is almost definitely a reference to [Mabel
Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink}, who is referred to as a
starling by [Veratrine](Veratrine "Veratrine"){.wikilink}; \"starling\"
is also the answer to a riddle referencing being caged, which Mabel is
for a vast majority of the podcast. The king of the crossroads is either
a reference to the King, to [Anna
Limón](Anna_Limón "Anna Limón"){.wikilink} (the current King), or to
[Thomas](Thomas "Thomas"){.wikilink}, who is stuck in a form of
\"crossroad\" due to his time loop. The mirror of snakes is probably
Mabel and [Luna Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink}, who share
a mirror. The Court as a whole often refer to Mabel as a snake or
snakeling. The prison of iron may be in regards to [Aurora
Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}\'s less-than-savory
methods of *gaining* these prophecies, through the torture of young
girls, specifically [Ekaterina
Roskova](Ekaterina_Roskova "Ekaterina Roskova"){.wikilink} and Mabel
Martin. Iron is also deadly to faeries, as shown when Mabel got shot and
promptly nearly died in [Episode Thirty-Two: Temporal
Snake](Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake "Episode Thirty-Two: Temporal Snake"){.wikilink}.
