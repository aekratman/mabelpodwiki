==Trivia== `<small>`{=html}**Please note that this section contains

- \"Monsters are never only one thing\...I think that's why -- that's
  why they're monstrous, because they move between worlds.\" can
  obviously link to \"I am the labyrinth, Anna, and *I am also the
  Minotaur.*\" Mabel, the world-hopper, *is* the monster.
- Lily disappeared on April 3^rd^, 1990. Mabel was very young.
- Anna believed that Sally was kind. She was wrong, of course, but it\'s
  still startling to hear it.
- Asterion is believed by some to be the name of the Minotaur. The term
  \"Minotaur\" literally just means \"Mino\'s Bull.\"
