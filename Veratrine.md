## Trivia

- According to her creator, [Maybell
  Marten](Maybell_Marten "Maybell Marten"){.wikilink}, in a [tumblr
  post](https://mabelpodcast.tumblr.com/post/633694944127762432/hey-yall-thank-you-for-making-this-very-good),
  Veratrine is both \[quoted directly from the post for ease of access /
  to as not to miswrite anything\] \"most certainly not cis\" and meant
  to \"explore \[Mx. Marten\'s\] conceptualization of \[her\] own
  womanhood through the lens of being mixed-race.\"
- Following the above bullet, Veratrine is written by Maybell Marten;
  Luna Thorne, her \'opposite,\' is thus presumably written by [Becca De
  La Rosa](Becca_De_La_Rosa "Becca De La Rosa"){.wikilink}.
- Veratrine is only a few months old, and is often referred to as a
  child by Anna and Mabel. She insists on disliking them, though she
  seems to hold some fondness for them both (\"I wouldn\'t have left the
  girls!\" is a direct lines from her in episode 32, and she goes to
  Anna and Mabel for comfort when she needs it, even over Luna).
- Vera\'s technical titles are \"the god of self-regeneration\" and \"a
  god of black mud and creation.\"
- She\'s made, at least partially, of oak, moss, mud, twigs, and a piece
  of Anna Limón.
- She is a fan of eating Halloween candy.
