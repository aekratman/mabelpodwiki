## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

The episode opens with [Mabel](Mabel_Martin "Mabel"){.wikilink}
(referred to as Subject 7825) being experimented on, presumably during
her time at [El Segundo](El_Segundo_Academy "El Segundo"){.wikilink}.
Afterwards, we cut to [Anna](Anna_Lim√≥n "Anna"){.wikilink} and Mabel
talking about [Brandon](Brandon "Brandon"){.wikilink}, assuming he was
one of \"[Aurora Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}\'s
people\"; then they discuss the [King](The_King "King"){.wikilink}, and
that he happened to help them. Mabel and the House get into a fight, and
Mabel screams at Anna before the House moves both of them to the attic.
Mabel begins to have a mild panic attack, and tries to apologize to
Anna; Anna tells her she\'s just here to help, and Mabel tells her
she\'s been poisoned before the House begins to scream.

We cut back to [Janet](Janet_Kirk "Janet"){.wikilink}, who explains that
after she fell in the leaves in the previous episode, she felt like she
was drowning in the leaves before the House opened its doors for her;
she finds herself in a large room (possibly the Green Parlor?) which is
covered in graffiti, including a line that says JANET KIRK MEETS HER OWN
DEATH.

Back with the Girls, Anna is confused on why there are locusts
everywhere in the attic. The girls get into an argument. We briefly hear
an experiment involving someone called Subject 6163 before hearing from
Aconite, who talks about bugs and burrowing and her dad. She wishes to
devour the kingdom under the ground. Back with the girls, Anna attempts
to leave the attic, but the girls make up from their fight and Mabel
explains some of the abuse she went through in the attic; they discuss
the fact that the House may have eaten Brandon before the House drops
his dead body in front of them, which turns into a snake. Mabel panics
and repeats that \"they\'re coming back to do it again.\"\

- This is the first time Mabel is referred to as Subject 7825, though
  she was revealed to be a former cultist in [Aurora Silver is Willing
  to
  Wait](Episode_Twenty-Nine:_Aurora_Silver_is_Willing_to_Wait "Aurora Silver is Willing to Wait"){.wikilink}.
- Brandon\'s corpse being turned into a snake (this podcast is *so
  goddamn weird* /affectionate) could be a reference to the tagline of
  [King in the
  Labyrinth](Episode_Seven:_King_in_the_Labyrinth "King in the Labyrinth"){.wikilink}\--
  \"In which the snake begins to eat its own tail.\"
