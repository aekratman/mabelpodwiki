<h2 id="episode_summary">Episode Summary</h2>
<p>Directly after the phone call from "Becca and Mabel," Tressa Loses
Her Goddamn Mind, repeating that she's too old to be thrown into an
adventure like this; in stories, it only happens to children. After
reasoning through what's happening to her (<em>"I am trapped. In a
house. That might belong to a podcaster’s grandmother, and might be. A
fucking. Faerie house from a story. Either someone is playing a - Jesus,
an incredibly detailed and, and complicated joke on me, or. I was
talking to two. Characters. Who shouldn’t even -"</em>), she decides to
attempt to physically map out the house.</p>
<p>The house traps her in a loop of three rooms: The kitchen, the dining
room, and the Green Parlor, meaning she cannot map the entire place out.
After getting into a fight with the House over the loop, she sits down
in the dining room, where she looks at her instruction paper again. It
asks her who Lara Ouvriers is. Tressa explains that her mom died when
Tressa was six, and since her father couldn't take care of her due to
working at Amtrak, she ended up getting sent to <a
href="Lang_Primary_Conservatory_for_the_Disabled" class="wikilink"
title="Lang Primary Conservatory for the Disabled">Lang Primary
Conservatory for the Disabled</a>, which she mentions was once referred
to as Lang Primary Conservatory for Crippled Children; this is
presumably meant to symbolize the act of covering up less-than-pristine
history. Lara Ouvriers was her principal, who she describes as looking
exactly like <a href="Aurora_Silver" class="wikilink"
title="Aurora Silver">Aurora Silver</a>'s description from [ The
Consort](Episode_Thirty:_The_Consort ” The Consort”){.wikilink}.</p>
<p>Tressa says that after she took the ring from Larissa, she began
getting called into Lara's office, where the woman would ask her strange
questions. She eventually witnessed the cult sacrificing the Mourning
Dove in an attempt to summon the King of the Underhill. The paper tells
her to head to the Green Parlor, where she finds a dollhouse of the
House, with a miniature figure of herself inside.</p>

<ul>
<li>The dollhouse was based on one Tressa owned in childhood.</li>
<li>The Mourning Dove being a child seems to match with Mabel being
called "the starling" by the Court.</li>
