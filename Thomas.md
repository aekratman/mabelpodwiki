Thomas is a minor character in *Mabel*.

## Season One {#season_one}

Thomas is first referred to as The Visitor, who asks [Anna
Limón](Anna_Limón "Anna Limón"){.wikilink} how to get back to town
several times. He then continuously mouths *get out* at her, over and
over.[^1]

He comes back a few weeks later and tells Anna his story.[^2] He had
come to the Martin house lost years before and met [Lily
Martin](Lily_Martin "Lily Martin"){.wikilink}. She had invited him
inside and, though he never got to meet her, Thomas became the father to
[Mabel Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink}. He cared about
his daughter, but was now stuck in the Underhill, leaving him to die and
be unable to escape; thus, when Lily died, Mabel\'s care was placed on
[Sally Martin](Sally_Martin "Sally Martin"){.wikilink}. He tells Anna
(in Spanish so the House cannot listen) that she needs to find a door,
which eventually leads to her actions in
[Legacy](Episode_Fourteen:_Legacy "Legacy"){.wikilink} and
[Underworld](Episode_Sixteen:_Underworld "Underworld"){.wikilink}.

More information on Thomas can be found if you purchase *Mabel: A Year
of Letters*.
