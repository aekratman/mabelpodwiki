## Continuity

**`<small>`{=html}Please note that this section contains spoilers for

- Juniper and Lily share a mirror, as [Luna
  Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink} and
  [Mabel](Mabel_Martin "Mabel"){.wikilink} do. In accordance to the
  creators\' tumblr, you tend to share a mirror with the person you\'re
  in love with when you\'re a Martin (unless, of course, your
  grandmother dammed the girl who loved her, leaving her to share a
  mirror with you, her very, very not human granddaughter who by all
  rights should be sharing with a rebellious nurse with a halo of curls
  etc etc.)
- The \"eating what you love\" metaphor sticks around.
