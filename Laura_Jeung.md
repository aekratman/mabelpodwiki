## What Happened At El Segundo {#what_happened_at_el_segundo}

In the 2002-2003 school year, Laura was a freshman at El Segundo
Academy. She was one of the few that returned to the school after
Christmas break and was housed in Meredith dormitory along with all the
other 38 remaining students. Due to the four-to-a-room nature of the
Meredith dorm, fighting increased. Laura and fellow freshman [Kinsey
McAllister](Kinsey_McAllister "Kinsey McAllister"){.wikilink} \"got into
a physical altercation over an item of clothing\"; in punishment, their
dorm monitor decided to burn all of their personal belongings on the
lawn of the school.\
