## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

This entire episode contains monologues of various characters talking to
[Mabel Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink}.

The first is [Aurora Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}.
She says that she does not play favorites among the children she is
around, and that she in fact dislikes children strongly, but that there
is something strange about Mabel. She wonders why Mabel is special. She
then states that she wishes to find out Mabel\'s secrets and will scoop
them out of Mabel\'s skull if she has to.

The second is [Eidolon
García](Eidolon_García "Eidolon García"){.wikilink}. She talks about a
spirit she saw outside her mother\'s house when she was twelve years
old. The spirit, a teenage boy continuously shooting himself, was
horrified when Lolo tried to save him. Lolo realized that being stuck in
a loop of his death was his \"heaven\", and he felt that he did
something meaningful by dying. Lolo then says that she was caught up in
what she stood for\-- trying to save him\-- without realizing she was
hurting him in the process. She tells Mabel that she\'s trying to
remember that Mabel is someone Anna loves, even though Lolo is scared
that Mabel represents a bringing of chaos Lolo says she can\'t stop
herself from \"hoping that maybe\--\" before the narrative cuts her off.

The third is [The Emissary](The_Emissary "The Emissary"){.wikilink}. He
talks about seeing a star fall and the entire world changing due to it;
he tells Mabel that the King feels \"a certain way\" about her, and that
she is his blind spot, which is dangerous due to the King\'s entropic
state. The Emissary says he has nothing against Mabel and calls her
\"little star\", linking her to the catastrophe he spoke about earlier.

The fourth is [Veratrine](Veratrine "Veratrine"){.wikilink}. Vera says
she\'s jealous of Mabel because of how \"\[Vera\'s\] image\" (presumably
Anna) looks at Mabel. Veratrine is jealous because she cannot get
emotions to settle onto her face like they do on Anna\'s. Vera says she
knows she should tell Luna what Mabel had said (see[ A
Superfluity](Episode_Forty-One:_A_Superfluity " A Superfluity"){.wikilink}),
but she won\'t, because she doesn\'t know whatever it is Mabel does.
Vera says she\'s afraid of what Mabel means and what it will bring to
herself and Luna; that Mabel is like a black hole, and that might have
been what the King had always saw in her.

The fifth is [Janet Kirk](Janet_Kirk "Janet Kirk"){.wikilink}. She talks
about her insecurities, saying that though she\'s been ghost hunting,
she\'s always worried that she didn\'t matter enough for the spirits she
searched for to try to put on a good show for her. She explains that
now, going back to the Martin House, is the first time she feels that
what she\'s doing matters. She says that both Mabel and Lolo are
\"larger than life\" and important, and that she isn\'t, but she feels
going to find Mabel is the most important thing she\'s ever done. Janet
thanks Mabel for helping her \"do something right\" and says she has a
good feeling about what they\'re going to do.

The sixth is [The House](The_House "The House"){.wikilink}, which plays
scratchy recordings of old songs. The lyrics played are as follows:
*lonely, lonely as can be / for I want you only \[STATIC\] want you only
\[STATIC\] you only\--* and *home, just like before / roam never no more
/ no place like home \[STATIC\] home \[STATIC\] home\--*

The seventh is [Anna Limón](Anna_Limón "Anna Limón"){.wikilink}, She
tells Mabel that she questions her memories sometimes, and isn\'t sure
how she grew up. She talks for a bit about keeping a notebook about the
good things that happened to her when she was a kid, and how she never
thought to keep a notebook of her and Mabel\'s time together, as she
never thought they\'d be apart. She says she remembers every part of her
time with Mabel and it doesn\'t matter if she isn\'t physically with
her: there\'s no \"unwriting what \[they\'ve\] made.\" She explains that
herself, Lolo, Janet, and (possibly) the Emissary will be driving back
to the House soon; she\'ll be getting back to Mabel soon, and promises
to find her if it \"kills her all over \[again\].\".\

*Special thanks to Sky for putting together the big transcript document
I used to find all these references!*

- \"Girl-ouroboros\" is one of Mabel\'s nicknames/titles. She is first
  called this by a faery in [Danse
  Macabre](Episode_Twenty-Six:_Danse_Macabre "Danse Macabre"){.wikilink};
  Anna mentions the nickname in [Ashes,
  Ashes](Episode_Forty-Four:_Ashes,_Ashes "Ashes, Ashes"){.wikilink}.
- Aurora Silver asks Mabel what makes her special; Jonathan questions a
  similar thing during his final monologue in [Ashes,
  Ashes](Episode_Forty-Four:_Ashes,_Ashes "Ashes, Ashes"){.wikilink}.
  She also says there is something special about Mabel in her first ever
  monologue during the beginning of [Aurora Silver is Willing to
  Wait](Episode_Twenty-Nine:_Aurora_Silver_is_Willing_to_Wait "Aurora Silver is Willing to Wait"){.wikilink}.
- The spirit Lolo watches die is presumably
  [Brandon](Brandon "Brandon"){.wikilink}, the teenage boy who shot
  himself in [Temporal
  Snake](Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake "Temporal Snake"){.wikilink}
  in order to do something that matters to the world around him (see
  [this](https://mabelpodcast.tumblr.com/post/633693856272105472/do-you-have-any-random-details-about-brandon-from)
  tumblr post).
  - The repetitive loop Lolo mentions can also be linked to
    [Thomas](Thomas "Thomas"){.wikilink}\'s ultimate fate.
  - In [Killing the
    Moon,](Episode_Fifteen:_Killing_the_Moon "Killing the Moon,"){.wikilink}
    Mabel says that she thought \"the worst thing in the world was
    repetition\".
  - In [The King
    Speaks](Episode_Thirty-One:_The_King_Speaks "The King Speaks"){.wikilink},
    the King says that \"There are no endings, only repetition.\"
- The Emissary then refers to the King\'s force of entropy as having no
  ending\-- make of that what you will.
- The Emissary also says Mabel has a lovely voice, and that previously
  that was all that would have mattered. Mabel once told Anna that the
  Hill would make her \"sing for \[her\] supper\" (see
  ([Orientation](Episode_Seventeen:_Orientation "Orientation"){.wikilink}).
- Veratrine says watching Anna is like watching a mirror \"if your
  reflection didn't care at all about what you wanted.\" Mabel\'s
  reflection is Luna Thorne, who is exactly that.
- Vera calls Mabel a black hole. In [Temporal
  Snake](Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake "Temporal Snake"){.wikilink},
  Mabel says that Aurora Silver is as incomprehensibly dense as a black
  hole. In [Reverie](Episode_Thirty-Nine:_Reverie "Reverie"){.wikilink},
  Mabel refers to the Martin House as a black hole.
- Anna references motherhood several times through her monologue, which
  is an overarching motif in the show.
- Anna says she remembers everything about her time with Mabel. In [The
  Consort](Episode_Thirty:_The_Consort "The Consort"){.wikilink}, Mabel
  says that she remembers everything Anna says: \"All of it. Every
  single word.\"
- Anna calls the House both hers and
  [Sally](Sally_Martin "Sally"){.wikilink}\'s, which has happened
  several times throughout the show.
- Anna says she\'d tied her thread around Mabel\'s wrist; this
  references Anna being the ball of thread in the [Crete
  Hierarchy](Crete_Hierarchy "Crete Hierarchy"){.wikilink}.
- In [Underworld](Episode_Sixteen:_Underworld "Underworld"){.wikilink},
  Anna is referred to as \"a gift tied in ribbon.\" She also says
  \"Didn't I say I'd come after you, hand over hand, fist over fist,
  into the rot of the black earth, into the labyrinth?\" This ties to
  her saying \"I can make my way, hand over hand, to you\" here.
- Anna says the King put Mabel in the seed of the universe\-- this could
  reference the acorn he used as his champion during [Temporal
  Snake](Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake "Temporal Snake"){.wikilink}.
  Anna also refers to herself as a seed several times, and drinks a
  poison involving seeds to die in
  [Legacy](Episode_Fourteen:_Legacy "Legacy"){.wikilink}. Mabel says she
  has planted seeds of herself everywhere in
  [Matryoshka](Episode_Twenty-Eight:_Matryoshka "Matryoshka"){.wikilink}.
- Anna says the roads to the House are the map of her heart, referencing
  the line from [The
  Freeze](Episode_Eight:_Freeze "The Freeze"){.wikilink}: *If the house
  is a heart, you're the hook cut through it.*

## Trivia

`<small>`{=html}**Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.**`</small>`{=html}

- [Maybell Marten](Maybell_Marten "Maybell Marten"){.wikilink} reads the
  introduction to this episode; in every other episode, [Becca De La
  Rosa](Becca_De_La_Rosa "Becca De La Rosa"){.wikilink} has that
  particular honor. Mrs. De La Rosa still reads the end credits.
- The \"in which\" portion of the episode is identical to the one from
  the original [The
  Letters](Episode_One:_The_Letters "The Letters"){.wikilink}.
- Seeing as the Emissary referred to himself as a bird in [Daddy
  Issues](Episode_Forty-Five:_Daddy_Issues "Daddy Issues"){.wikilink},
  the star he references changing the entire world could be the meteor
  which killed the dinosaurs (\"oceans split, earth walked\") as birds
  evolved from dinosaurs.
