## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Anna gets back to the House and finds Mabel able to communicate with her
through the lights. They have a fight after Anna explains what happened
to her; then Anna gets a phone call that Sally has passed away. [The
King](The_King "The King"){.wikilink} comes in on Mabel\'s end and Anna
tells Mabel a story about her nephew to distract her and keep her safe
from the King. The episode ends with Anna asking Mabel to stay alive
until she\'s able to get her out of the Underhill.\

- Anna assumes the King is hurting Mabel in some way; rather ironically,
  Sally was the one who did that, and she\'s the one Anna is currently
  mourning.
- Anna was afraid of Luna, originally; now that she\'s King, that\'s
  kind of out the window. In season seven, Mabel (and by extension Anna)
  are both intent on getting Luna back for what she\'s done.
