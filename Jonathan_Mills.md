Jonathan is portrayed by [Becca De La
Rosa](Becca_De_La_Rosa "Becca De La Rosa"){.wikilink} in season four and
[C.S.W](C.S.W. "C.S.W"){.wikilink} in season seven. This page contains
discussion of death, bullying, abuse, homophobia, and suicide.

## Season Four {#season_four}

Jonathan is a member of [Aurora
Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}\'s cult and has been
since he was a teenager. He records [The
King](The_King "The King"){.wikilink}\'s voice and then loses it, which
makes Aurora Silver incredibly angry. In retribution, she sends
[Brandon](Brandon "Brandon"){.wikilink}, Jonathan\'s apprentice (?), off
to his death in the [Martin
House.](The_House "Martin House."){.wikilink}

Jonathan grew up rich and spoiled. When he was sent to [Green
Pines](Green_Pines "Green Pines"){.wikilink}, the academy for troubled
boys he attended as a teenager, he dealt with severe abuse by his
classmates, which was implied to be homophobic in nature. Aurora Silver
saved him from being killed by his bullies, and he\'s been completely
loyal to her ever since\-- *specifically* her, not to the cult nor to
the supernatural beliefs they follow.[^1]\
==Season Seven== Jonathan is mentioned in [A
Superfluity](Episode_Forty-One:_A_Superfluity "A Superfluity"){.wikilink};
Aurora Silver says he\'s been recording more messages from the King.
Seeing as we don\'t know when this takes place in the timeline, it could
be from before his last appearance.

Next time we hear from him, he has decided to rebel against Aurora
Silver because he feels Brandon\'s death was unfair and petty. He
records a contingency plan in case he is killed and says that he has no
religion or loyalty towards Aurora, who he feels is like a political
extremist. He realized due to Brandon\'s death that none of the cultists
matter to her, so he\'s decided to wait until he is either killed or
finds a way to make the deaths of his peers mean something.[^2]

Our last time hearing from Jonathan is his final monlogue. He\'s
speaking to Mabel, saying he had read her file (from when she was [ a
subject](The_Subjects " a subject"){.wikilink}) when he was still in
school. He says that even if he could have, he would not have saved her,
because he was more concerned with following orders. Nonetheless, he\'s
has read the files of many subjects in an attempt to humanize them.

He says that Aurora Silver thought Mabel was special, and that he knows
*he* isn\'t\-- he\'s a foot soldier and isn\'t ashamed of it. He says he
would have died if he has been special like Mabel was, and knows that as
a soldier, he has been put to \"ill use.\" We hear him cutting his own
skin, repeating that what he\'s saying isn\'t a confession. He
apologizes to Mabel and begins to break down about what happened to both
her and to Brandon; he says \"This isn\'t a confession. This is an
obituary. `<i>`{=html} Get out.`</i>`{=html}\" before noises of burning
and a stag roaring overwhelm the soundscape. This implies his
suicide.[^3]
