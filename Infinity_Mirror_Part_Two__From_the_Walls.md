## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

The episode begins with Tressa trying in vain to call [Becca De La
Rosa](Becca_De_La_Rosa "Becca De La Rosa"){.wikilink}. The windows and
doors begin to rattle and screech, and Tressa starts screaming; we then
cut to her reading the next step on the list, to eat an apple and
discuss what she left behind. She talks about empathizing with Anna and
then reassures herself that the two podcasters aren\'t trying to murder
her.

She eats the apple and explains that she left behind her dad and her
cats. Tressa realizes the noise and singing around her is coming out of
the House\'s walls, and then talks about the dollhouse she was given as
a child before asking if \"Becca\'s\" grandmother is, in fact, [Sally
Martin](Sally_Martin "Sally Martin"){.wikilink}.

She reads the next point on the list\-- \"Remember the mourning dove\"
\-- and starts freaking out, asking how they could have known, because
she\'d never told *anyone*.
