## All Seasons {#all_seasons}

Aaron asks questions with no real answers and knows when adults lie to
him. When his aunt [Anna](Anna_Limón "Anna"){.wikilink} was upset one
day before the events of the podcast, he drew her a picture of a bear
(named Bartholomew) who he said would keep her safe. Throughout all of
her adventures, Anna has kept the picture.[^1]
