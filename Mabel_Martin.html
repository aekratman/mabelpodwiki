Mabel Martin is played by <a href="Maybell_Marten" class="wikilink"
title="Maybell Marten">Maybell Marten</a>. She is one of the two main
protagonists of <em>Mabel</em>. Please be warned that this page
discusses heavy themes of abuse.</p>
<h2 id="season_one">Season One</h2>
<p>Mabel does not appear in a large part of season one, but we do learn
several details about her life. Her father's name was <a
href="Thomas_Ortega" class="wikilink" title="Thomas">Thomas</a>, and her
mother's name was <a href="Lily_Martin" class="wikilink"
title="Lily">Lily</a>; Thomas never got to meet Mabel, and Lily died
when she was four, leaving her to be raised by her maternal
grandparents. <a href="Sally_Martin" class="wikilink"
title="Sally Martin">Sally Martin</a>, her grandmother, abused her
throughout her entire life. Mabel's only allies in her youth were the
Court, who she was able to communicate with, and the <a href="The_House"
class="wikilink" title="House">House</a>, which cared about her more
than anything else. Mabel grew up "half feral and half faeral,"<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> showing a connection to Fairy Hill
from a very young age. <a href="Luna_Thorne" class="wikilink"
title="Luna Thorne">Luna Thorne</a> lived in her mirror, and while they
were close when Mabel was a child, Luna and Mabel began to fight after
an incident in the garden of the Martin home, when Mabel was bitten by a
fox.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> She doesn't remember a large portion
of her childhood.</p>
<p>She was sent off to El Segundo Academy around the age of twelve and
placed in the care of one <a href="Aurora_Silver" class="wikilink"
title="Aurora Silver">Aurora Silver</a>.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> She
was subsequently abused heavily once again--though the details are not
revealed within the show's canon, the audience does learn Mabel was put
through a series of experiments, including being fed poison and
presumably being harmed with iron, to which she is incredibly allergic.
The tapes these experiments are recorded on refer to her as Subject
7825. At some unknown point, Mabel is captured and held captive in the
Underhill.</p>
<p><a href="Anna_Limón" class="wikilink" title="Anna Limón">Anna
Limón</a> begins to call Mabel around November of 2016<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>,
and eventually drags herself into the Underhill to get Mabel back. Mabel
herself is heard from for the first time in episode seven, where she
continuously attempts to call Anna back. At the end of season one, Anna
goes into the Underworld and meets Mabel physically for the first
time.</p>
<h2 id="season_two">Season Two</h2>
<p>Anna returns to the House, with Mabel trapped in the walls, only able
to properly communicate by making the lights buzz. Anna then decides to
drink poison, swapping herself and Mabel, with Anna now stuck in the
Underhill full-time.</p>
<p>In the last episode of season two, Anna solves a series of riddles
and manages to find her way back to Mabel, leaving Mabel in the house
and herself in the Underhill again.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="season_three">Season Three</h2>
<p>Mabel is unused to the human world as a whole, and struggles with
being back. She's furious at Anna for both switching their places
without permission and for leaving her alone in the house that had
trapped her for so long; she alternates between screaming at Anna to
leave her alone and being terrified. She says that she isn't a person
anymore and makes several points that look towards her being some form
of changeling, though the creators of the podcast have confirmed that
Mabel is many things and cannot be defined simply by one term. It is
revealed in the first episode of this season that Mabel's voice actress
is <a href="Maybell_Marten" class="wikilink"
title="Maybell Marten">Maybell Marten</a>.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Mabel screams at Anna for trying to be the sacrificial lamb and/or a
self-loathing martyr. She begins to refer to the other woman as Saint
Anna and fights with one of Anna's friends when they call, worried about
her. She then breaks every mirror in the Martin home.</p>
<p>As she rages, Mabel tells Anna about Sally and Luna, and says that
she has no pity within her for either of them. Following Anna's journey
in <a href="Episode_Eleven:_Pilgrimage" class="wikilink"
title="Pilgrimage">Pilgrimage</a>, Mabel attempts to visit the cemetery
Sally is buried in in order to call Anna's friend again, before
realizing that she had never actually left the House at all--it has
trapped her once again, pretending to be the outside world. During this
time, Mabel realizes the Court has replaced Anna with a changeling
double.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>She gets to the garden and gives the House a piece of her arm in
order to keep herself bound to it, then finds a piece of her own hair in
the garden--and with it, Anna's double. The double chases Mabel around
and attempts to get her to fall in love with her, thus abandoning Anna
to the Underhill. It does not work, and Mabel eventually climbs a tree
before dropping a match onto her. In the ensuing corrupted version of
hide-and-seek, Mabel manages to kill Anna's double by strangling her.<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Anna returns after Mabel gives a piece of her arm to the House and
Mabel almost kills <em>her</em>, thinking it's the double attempting to
trick her again. However, the two girls work it out and manage to
finally kiss. Then they fight about one of them having to leave. They
hear the King's voice and Anna orders the House to let them both out,
revealing that Anna is now the god of the place. Anna calls Mabel
endless; then they go get the piece of arm Mabel had torn off in order
to get Anna back up to the House. Anna's skin on her hand burns off and
Mabel is half on fire at all times.</p>
<p>They then decide the best course of action is to murder the king.<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a><br />
</p>
<h2 id="season_four">Season Four</h2>
<p>The double, now calling herself <a href="Veratrine" class="wikilink"
title="Veratrine">Veratrine</a>, comes back, and comes with the girls as
they attempt to challenge the King. After Anna fails the first time,
Mabel explains to her the Rules of the place after they run back to the
House. Mabel gets eaten by the House, and after Anna gets her back by
tearing herself open, they go on an adventure involving Sally's old
grandfather clock, Mabel's collection of owl pellets, finding a drawing
of Lily's bedroom, and Anna finally telling Mabel she loves her. After
Mabel stops being dumbstruck over that, they break into Lily's room and
find a datura seedling, which makes them believe the cycle is starting
once again. They then go on to find Mabel's childhood diary, which
allows them to understand that there needs to be a ritual involved with
challenging the king. Mabel gets Vera not to run away and they head back
to the Underhill, where they find Luna Thorne possessing a faerie. Anna
and Mabel have another fight when Mabel calls herself more of a faerie
than a human. Mabel gets really upset due to the fact that she listens
to literally everything Anna says with no way to stop; she compares Anna
to Sally. Anna then explains that she came to the Martin house after
she'd "cut the cord" on the visions of another girl she saw throughout
college--that girl, of course, being Mabel.</p>
<p>They make up and go challenge the King properly, Anna naming Mabel as
her champion. After they win, Anna fully frees Mabel of her bonds to
her, and tells Mabel she's free to leave if she wants to. She doesn't,
though, and they have a very nice scene before a boy named <a
href="Brandon" class="wikilink" title="Brandon">Brandon</a> shows up
where they're walking and shoots himself in the head, the bullet
ricocheting off and hitting Mabel's arm.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="season_six">Season Six</h2>
<p>Mabel screams at Anna not to touch her or the bullet wound. Anna gets
her to calm down by telling her secrets, and Mabel faints. After Anna
patches her up, they get put in the attic, where Mabel seems to have a
small flashback; she then tells Anna that the bullet had poisoned her
without saying anything else on the matter. They have a fight. Anna gets
Mabel to tell her why there are locusts in the attic--as previously
mentioned, it's what Mabel ate when she was locked inside--before having
another fight because Mabel misinterprets what Anna is saying. The body
of the dead boy comes back and a snake jumps out from it. Anna drags a
now-unconscious Mabel away. Anna solves more riddles to find that Mabel
is allergic to iron and that she needs to cut out every piece of flesh
the bullet touched in order for Mabel to heal.</p>
<p>Mabel wakes up and they go to Anna's coronation, where <a
href="Ekaterina_Roskova" class="wikilink" title="Aconite">Aconite</a>
challenges them for the throne.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Using a box of SD
cards that the House had given Anna (recorded torture sessions from
Aurora Silver), they convince Aconite that she's not the true heir to
the throne, and Anna is crowned, naming Mabel as her queen.</p>
<p>Anna is found at the end of the last episode of season six in the
"real" world again, with no sign whatsoever of Mabel.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="season_seven">Season Seven</h2>
<p>In <a href="Eidolon_García" class="wikilink"
title="Eidolon">Eidolon</a> and <a href="Janet_Kirk" class="wikilink"
title="Janet">Janet</a>'s world where the seventh season takes place,
Mabel has been dead for years after being force-fed glass by Sally
Martin.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> We see Mabel in flashbacks, where
she spends time with Anna. They discover the King transformed into some
form of shadow monster in the Underhill; later, Anna reveals to Mabel
that she'd found Sally's old diary. Anna tells Mabel that Sally made a
deal with Luna and tricked her in order to rebirth her brother <a
href="Phillip_Martin" class="wikilink" title="Phillip">Phillip</a> in
the form of her daughter <a href="Lily_Martin" class="wikilink"
title="Lily">Lily</a>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>We learn more about Mabel's past from Eidolon and Janet's research.
Lolo has several redacted files from Mabel' s past, and she tells Anna
about how this universe's Mabel died. When she was eleven, after the
force-feeding glass incident, Mabel was sent to live with a foster
family. Lily, who had been sent away to a behavior facility, returned to
the Martin House on a day that Mabel was there (for some unknown
reason). Lily left the House covered in Mabel's blood and promptly got
into a fatal car accident. They never found Mabel's actual body, but the
House was covered in her blood, and she was presumed dead.</p>
<p>Lolo and Janet take Anna to see Mabel's grave as, throughout the
narrative, we hear from our own version of Mabel. She gets into fights
with Lily-- god knows where in the timeline THAT is-- and has panic
attacks, screaming for her father (the King, presumably) to help her.
Back in Lolo's world, <a href="The_Emissary" class="wikilink"
title="The Emissary">The Emissary</a> reveals to the road trip trio that
our version of Mabel has been taken back by the King, and Lolo tells
Anna that trying to get her back will result in the destabilization of
Eidolon and Janet's entire world. Anna does not care.<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>In an attempt to get her back, the road trip trio go to the House and
attempt to pull off a summoning game in some way similar to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_banishing_ritual_of_the_pentagram">Lesser
Banishing Ritual.</a> Janet is pulled into the walls of the House while
trying to get Mabel out-- at the end, while Anna begs Mabel to wake up
in her arms, only Mabel's voice is heard, reciting <a href="Mabel?"
class="wikilink" title="Mabel?">Mabel?</a>'s lines from <a
href="Episode_Forty-One:_A_Superfluity" class="wikilink"
title="A Superfluity">A Superfluity</a>: <em>I saw a thicket of trees
break open like an  egg from a limpia. I saw a girl walk into the dark
woods with her mouth open  and her hand outstretched towards the flaming
sky. I saw a girl cut from herself  the rib from which to make the
world. I saw a girl thresh god out of her belly.</em><a href="#fn16"
