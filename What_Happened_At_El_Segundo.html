<p>What Happened At El Segundo is an extra content page dropped in the
transcript of <a href="Episode_Forty-Three:_Seeled" class="wikilink"
title="Seeled">Seeled</a> on January 28, 2022. It is currently
offline.</p>
<h2 id="all_content">All Content</h2>
<p>This page was written by <a href="Eidolon_García" class="wikilink"
title="Eidolon García">Eidolon García</a> and discusses what happened at
the boarding school <a href="El_Segundo_Academy" class="wikilink"
title="El Segundo Academy">El Segundo Academy</a>, where Mabel Martin
went to school. The site itself is a summary of how El Segundo came to
be and eventually burned down. It focuses on April 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2003,
in which the entire school burned down in unexplainable circumstances.
It also discusses <a href="Maribeth_Parker" class="wikilink"
title="Maribeth Parker">Maribeth Parker</a> and her role in the school.
Now, past Curator was like "haha, no point in summarizing it again!" but
actually this is a free excuse to talk about ESA! Let's go!</p>
<h2 id="background_pre_2003">Background (Pre-2003)</h2>
<p>El Segundo was a "pseudo-therapeutic, borderline militaristic" school
for troubled girls located in California. It was founded by Gertrude
Edgeworth, who used to experiment on kids in the '40s and '50s. It
engaged in unhealthy punishments for its teenage residents. In the
2002-2003 school year, only 54 girls were enrolled, living stuck
together in two dorms meant to hold only 40 people total. A former
student named <a href="Elizabeth_Hook" class="wikilink"
title="Elizabeth Hook">Elizabeth Hook</a> was found dead by an ESA
sophomore in September. Everything continued to get weirder from there:
the music department floods; students become trapped by a circled group
of wild foxes; a student named <a href="Talia_Moore" class="wikilink"
title="Talia Moore">Talia Moore</a> has a red oak fall on her; strange
sounds echo through Meredith Dorm; eggs are found full of stones; part
of the school collapses.</p>
<p>As if the school environment can't get worse, girls began to
regularly pass out in assembly and the school's horses went missing. The
school's director, <a href="Ron_Newman" class="wikilink"
title="Ron Newman">Ron Newman</a>, also went missing and was found
covered in black mud five days later. Rattlesnakes were found in his
office. His spot at the school was never filled after he went to an
assisted living facility, which meant that the three kids who stayed at
ESA over winter break were left alone during a blizzard.</p>
<p>After winter break, the 38 remaining ESA girls are all crushed into
Meredith dorm, sleeping four to a room. Vines began to grow into the
building. Two freshmen-- <a href="Laura_Jeung" class="wikilink"
title="Laura Jeung">Laura Jeung</a> and <a href="Kinsey_McAllister"
class="wikilink" title="Kinsey McAllister">Kinsey McAllister</a>-- got
into a fistfight and their dorm monitor burnt all of their personal
possessions. Kinsey got third-degree burns while trying to grab a
stuffed animal from the fire and was taken out of El Segundo by her
parents.</p>
<h2 id="april_3rd_2003">April 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2003</h2>
<p>At 9:18 A.M, <a href="Callie" class="wikilink"
title="Callie">Callie</a> placed a call to the Jericho fire department.
She was terrified that someone was going to find her and hung up before
the switchboard operator could figure out what was going on. Two Jericho
police officers, <a href="Officer_Holbrook" class="wikilink"
title="Officer Holbrook">Officer Holbrook</a> and <a
href="Officer_Avila" class="wikilink" title="Officer Avila">Officer
Avila</a>, were sent to ESA after the call was traced. <a
href="Maribeth_Parker" class="wikilink" title="Maribeth Parker">Maribeth
Parker</a>-- the vice-dean of students-- refused to let them in. When
the cops were about to leave, a window exploded with black smoke, and
they forced their way into the building past Parker. Avila died and
Holbrook received severe burn wounds. Meredith dorm flooded while the
main ESA building (and the running field) burned for 17 hours straight.
Maribeth Parker disappeared and strange artifacts were found in her
office.</p>
