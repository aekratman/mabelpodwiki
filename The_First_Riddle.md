## The Riddle {#the_riddle}

Knock once for the hound of the sun.

Knock twice for the hare of the moon.

Three times for the vigilant one.

Four times too soon.

The hound swallows stars on his tongue.

The hare eats the heart of the moon.

The queen's harp is never unstrung,

Never so soon.

Four times for the door in the hill.

Five times for the gold afternoon.

Six knows what she's done, and still --

Too soon, too soon.\

## Speculation

The Hound and Hare refer to, respectively, [the
King](the_King "the King"){.wikilink} and [Luna
Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink}. The vigilant one could
refer to [Anna](Anna_&_Mabel "Anna"){.wikilink}, who\'s the main
riddle-solver in the podcast and also commonly has to make deals in
threes. Four is both considered a lucky and unlucky number, so that
could have any number of meanings.

The queen\'s harp also has no confirmed meaning, though it could refer
to [Mabel](Mabel_Martin "Mabel"){.wikilink}, Anna\'s queen. The door in
the hill is probably a reference to Anna\'s descent in episode sixteen.
The gold afternoon could refer to one of Mabel\'s memories *or* Anna\'s
monologue in episode fourteen. Six has always struck the author of this
wiki as Aurora Silver (A-U-R-O-R-A is six letters, and she damn well
knows what she\'s done), but using this logic, it could also refer to
Monica or even the Martin name (both six letters).
