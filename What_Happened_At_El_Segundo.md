This page was written by [Eidolon
García](Eidolon_García "Eidolon García"){.wikilink} and discusses what
happened at the boarding school [El Segundo
Academy](El_Segundo_Academy "El Segundo Academy"){.wikilink}, where
Mabel Martin went to school. The site itself is a summary of how El
Segundo came to be and eventually burned down. It focuses on April
3^rd^, 2003, in which the entire school burned down in unexplainable
circumstances. It also discusses [Maribeth
Parker](Maribeth_Parker "Maribeth Parker"){.wikilink} and her role in
the school. Now, past Curator was like \"haha, no point in summarizing
it again!\" but actually this is a free excuse to talk about ESA! Let\'s
go!

## Background (Pre-2003) {#background_pre_2003}

El Segundo was a \"pseudo-therapeutic, borderline militaristic\" school
for troubled girls located in California. It was founded by Gertrude
Edgeworth, who used to experiment on kids in the \'40s and \'50s. It
engaged in unhealthy punishments for its teenage residents. In the
2002-2003 school year, only 54 girls were enrolled, living stuck
together in two dorms meant to hold only 40 people total. A former
student named [Elizabeth
Hook](Elizabeth_Hook "Elizabeth Hook"){.wikilink} was found dead by an
ESA sophomore in September. Everything continued to get weirder from
there: the music department floods; students become trapped by a circled
group of wild foxes; a student named [Talia
Moore](Talia_Moore "Talia Moore"){.wikilink} has a red oak fall on her;
strange sounds echo through Meredith Dorm; eggs are found full of
stones; part of the school collapses.

As if the school environment can\'t get worse, girls began to regularly
pass out in assembly and the school\'s horses went missing. The
school\'s director, [Ron Newman](Ron_Newman "Ron Newman"){.wikilink},
also went missing and was found covered in black mud five days later.
Rattlesnakes were found in his office. His spot at the school was never
filled after he went to an assisted living facility, which meant that
the three kids who stayed at ESA over winter break were left alone
during a blizzard.

After winter break, the 38 remaining ESA girls are all crushed into
Meredith dorm, sleeping four to a room. Vines began to grow into the
building. Two freshmen\-- [Laura
Jeung](Laura_Jeung "Laura Jeung"){.wikilink} and [Kinsey
McAllister](Kinsey_McAllister "Kinsey McAllister"){.wikilink}\-- got
into a fistfight and their dorm monitor burnt all of their personal
possessions. Kinsey got third-degree burns while trying to grab a
stuffed animal from the fire and was taken out of El Segundo by her
parents.

## April 3^rd^, 2003 {#april_3rd_2003}

At 9:18 A.M, [Callie](Callie "Callie"){.wikilink} placed a call to the
Jericho fire department. She was terrified that someone was going to
find her and hung up before the switchboard operator could figure out
what was going on. Two Jericho police officers, [Officer
Holbrook](Officer_Holbrook "Officer Holbrook"){.wikilink} and [Officer
Avila](Officer_Avila "Officer Avila"){.wikilink}, were sent to ESA after
the call was traced. [Maribeth
Parker](Maribeth_Parker "Maribeth Parker"){.wikilink}\-- the vice-dean
of students\-- refused to let them in. When the cops were about to
leave, a window exploded with black smoke, and they forced their way
into the building past Parker. Avila died and Holbrook received severe
burn wounds. Meredith dorm flooded while the main ESA building (and the
running field) burned for 17 hours straight. Maribeth Parker disappeared
and strange artifacts were found in her office.
