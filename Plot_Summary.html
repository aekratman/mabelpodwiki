<h2 id="seasons_1_2_3_4_6_and_7">Seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7</h2>
<p>[Where's season five? Check <a href="Infinity_Mirror"
class="wikilink" title="here.">here.</a>]</p>
<p>A home help worker named <a href="Anna_Limón" class="wikilink"
title="Anna Limón">Anna Limón</a> goes to live in a creepy old <a
href="The_House" class="wikilink" title="house">house</a> to work for an
elderly lady named <a href="Sally_Martin" class="wikilink"
title="Sally Martin">Sally Martin</a>. One day, Anna finds a box filled
with letters in the attic. When Sally sees it, she begins to scream the
words "I'm going into the ground for you." Curious and looking for
answers, Anna begins to contact Sally's only living relative: her
missing granddaughter, <a href="Mabel_Martin" class="wikilink"
title="Mabel Martin">Mabel Martin</a>. Through several treasure hunts,
Anna learns that the letters are from <a href="Luna_Thorne"
class="wikilink" title="Luna Thorne">Luna Thorne</a>, a citizen of Fairy
Hill-- an underworld-like area under the Martin Place. She also learns
that Mabel has been trapped there by the ruler of the Hill, who is known
only as <a href="the_King" class="wikilink" title="the King">the
King</a>.</p>
<p>Sally ends up being taken to the garden by a faery and left to die of
hypothermia. Anna finds her just before she dies and brings her to the
hospital. Anna asks Sally what's going on with the letters at the
hospital, but Sally isn't able to answer. When Anna goes back to the
Martin House, she is taken into the hill by Luna Thorne and meets Mabel
for the first time. She falls head-over-heels in love with her and,
after returning to the real world and realizing Sally is now dead,
decides there's nothing left for her in the real world. Thus, she
decides to drink poison to open a door into the Hill and swap her place
with Mabel (after receiving advice from Mabel's long-dead father, <a
href="Thomas" class="wikilink" title="Thomas">Thomas</a>). Mabel ends up
in the Martin House, while Anna-- now dead-- is trapped in the hill.</p>
<p>Mabel tries to get back to Anna, which is complicated somewhat by
Luna creating a clone of Anna to take her real-world place. Mabel kills
the clone and makes a deal with the House to get back into the Hill, and
gets back to Anna. Anna, Mabel, and the reborn clone-- now calling
herself <a href="Veratrine" class="wikilink"
title="Veratrine">Veratrine</a>-- decide to kill the King in order to
take his place and become the rulers of the hill. They pull it off as a
cult (led by a woman named <a href="Aurora_Silver" class="wikilink"
title="Aurora Silver">Aurora Silver</a>, who is trying to capture the
King) chases them down. Just as Anna wins the fight against the King, a
cultist named <a href="Brandon" class="wikilink"
title="Brandon">Brandon</a> arrives and shoots himself after repeating
Sally's line-- "I'm going into the ground for you." The bullet
richochets off of him and hits Mabel's arm.</p>
<p>This leaves Anna dealing with several crises: Mabel is dying due to
the bullet, Anna has to be coronated to become the true king of the hill
even as the entire Faery Court chases her down, <em>and</em> a woman who
believes herself to be the Old King's daughter is trying to steal Anna's
throne. It turns out this woman, Aconite, is actually a cultist with
amnesia due to the trauma she experienced. Anna saves Mabel and helps
Aconite before being coronated, becoming the King of the Underhill.
Mabel becomes her consort.</p>
<p>Just as they're about to get their happy ending, a paranormal
investigator named <a href="Janet_Kirk" class="wikilink"
title="Janet Kirk">Janet Kirk</a> runs into the Martin House and pulls
Anna back into the real world. Anna, Janet, and Janet's friend <a
href="Eidolon_García" class="wikilink" title="Eidolon">Eidolon</a> (who
chases ghosts) are currently on a road trip trying to figure out the
secrets of Janet and Eidolon's world-- which is not Anna's original
world, seeing as Mabel is dead in this one-- while also avoiding the
cult. Mabel's current wherabouts are unknown.</p>
