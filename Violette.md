thanks to me.*\

## Season Seven {#season_seven}

Violette is presumably a member of [Aurora
Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}\'s cult and works with
Aurora. In season seven, she\'s said to be in Nice, France; Aurora tells
her about a message [Jonathan](Jonathan_Mills "Jonathan"){.wikilink}
found.[^1] She is said to be working with the cult to resolve her
\"daddy issues\", according to Aurora Silver, and apparently spends a
large sum of her budget on frivolous things.

## Trivia
