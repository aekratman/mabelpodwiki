<p>In which we all fall down. Featuring: a cacophony of voices.</p>
<p><strong>Episode description:</strong> <em>An unlit match is a
terrible thing</em>.</p>
<h2 id="episode_overview">Episode Overview</h2>
<p><em>I was a tear shed / for the ones that died believing–</em></p>
<h4 id="trigger_warnings"><strong>Trigger Warnings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><em><u>GRAPHIC DEPICTION OF SUICIDE</u></em></strong>,
abuse, arguments, death, unreality, distortion, crying, anxiety attacks,
panic attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="episode_summary">Episode Summary</h2>
<p>This episode begins with [ Mabel](Mabel_Martin ” Mabel”){.wikilink}
talking to [ Lily](Lily_Martin ” Lily”){.wikilink}, who's words are
garbled and unclear. Mabel says that the house is more hers than it is
Lily's, and screams at her to leave her alone. As a scuffle sounds out,
Mabel screams that Lily will burn, and that "he" (presumably <a
href="The_King" class="wikilink" title="The King">The King</a>) will
burn and kill her.</p>
<p>Cutting off to <a href="Aurora_Silver" class="wikilink"
title="Aurora Silver">Aurora Silver</a>, we find her on the phone with
<a href="Violette" class="wikilink" title="Violette">Violette</a>, who
has not been answering her calls. She says she's been having computer
troubles. Aurora scolds her for it.</p>
<p>Over to [ Anna](Anna_Limón ” Anna”){.wikilink}, we find her
monologuing about trying to find Mabel. [ Janet](Janet_Kirk ”
Janet”){.wikilink} and [ Lolo](Eidolon_García ” Lolo”){.wikilink} are
near her, whispering among themselves about what exactly Anna is doing.
Janet offers Anna a Caprisun and Anna waves her off, asking her about El
Segundo. Lolo explains that it was a residential school for rich girls,
filled with institutional abuse. Janet says it burned for an entire day,
but no one could figure out how the fire started. After discussing what
was found in the [ vice-dean](Maribeth_Parker ” vice-dean”){.wikilink}'s
room, Anna mutters "girl-ouroboros" to herself. She explains that that
was one of Mabel's nicknames. Janet asks if Mabel is dead or not, and
Anna calls her stupid, which Lolo gets offended at. After they talk
about whether or not Anna's alive, Anna breaks down slightly, saying it
doesn't matter if she's dead or alive; if she's here, walking and
talking and being <em>here</em>, that means Mabel can, in turn, be
somewhere.</p>
<p>We cut to Cult 1 and Cult 2-- <a href="Brandon" class="wikilink"
title="Brandon">Brandon</a> and [ Jonathan](Jonathan_Mills ”
Jonathan”){.wikilink}, respectively-- when they began to record the
King. Brandon asks if Jonathan can believe they're doing this, and
Jonathan answers that he believes everything. Brandon goes to touch a
vine in the room, which Jonathan says is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brugmansia">brugmansia</a>. Brandon
says that it looks like it spells something, but it cuts off before he
can say which particular word it resembles.</p>
<p>We cut off to Mabel, who is stuck somewhere-- at first a bower, then
the House. She asks why anyone can't ever leave her alone, and talks
about the House collapsing inward; she is scared of something looming
around her to "remake [her] until she is fit for purpose", making her
smaller and having her thank her abusers for hurting her. She begins to
cry, and asks for her father to help her.</p>
<p>We hear a countdown and then cut to Jonathan in the present day. He's
speaking to Mabel, saying he had read her file (from when she was [ a
subject](The_Subjects ” a subject”){.wikilink}) when he was still in
school. He says that even if he could have, he would not have saved her,
because he was more concerned with following orders. Nonetheless,
Jonathan has read the files of many subjects in an attempt to humanize
them. He says that Aurora Silver thought Mabel was special, and that he
knows he isn't-- he's a foot soldier and isn't ashamed of it. He says he
would have died if he has been special like Mabel was, and knows that as
a soldier, he has been put to "ill use." We hear him cutting his own
skin, repeating that what he's saying isn't a confession. He apologizes
to Mabel and begins to break down about what happened to both her and to
Brandon; he says "This isn't a confession. This is an obituary. <em> Get
out.</em>" before noises of burning and a stag roaring overwhelm the
soundscape. The episode ends.</p>

<ul>
<li>The description of this episode (“In which <em>we</em> all fall
down”) is a callback to <a href="Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake"
class="wikilink" title="Temporal Snake">Temporal Snake</a>’s description
(“In which <em>they</em> all fall down”). The change from “they” to “we”
may be a reference to Mabel’s status as a former cult subject being
clear in this season.</li>
<li>Brugmansia is a member of the same family as nightshade. My
wonderful plant expert friend Danny will explain more about what this
means later !!</li>
<li>“Get out” is also an important line for <a href="Thomas"
class="wikilink" title="Thomas">Thomas</a>.</li>
<li>We can assume that Mabel’s talking about the King when she asks for
her father to help her, as on the <a
href="https://mabelpodcast.tumblr.com/">official tumblr</a>, <a
href="Maybell_Marten" class="wikilink" title="Maybell Marten">Maybell
Marten</a> refers to the King specifically as her father. Though Thomas
has also been referred to as Mabel’s father (by Anna), the term has
never been used for him by Mabel herself.</li>
