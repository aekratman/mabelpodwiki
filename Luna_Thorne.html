Luna Thorne is a secondary antagonist (amongst other things) in
<em>Mabel</em>. Her voice actress is never credited, though it can be
assumed she is played by <a href="Maybell_Marten" class="wikilink"
title="Maybell Marten">Maybell Marten</a>.</p>
<h2 id="season_one">Season One</h2>
<p>Luna Thorne is many things, and none of them are simple to summarize.
One concrete fact is that Luna is the girl in <a href="Mabel_Martin"
class="wikilink" title="Mabel Martin">Mabel Martin</a>'s mirror; her
face is scarred on the side opposite to where Mabel's is. They spoke
often when Mabel was a child, until an incident when Mabel was bitten by
a fox; she and Luna then began fighting, to the point where Mabel would
either cover or break every mirror in the <a href="The_House"
class="wikilink" title="House">House</a> in order to avoid seeing
Luna.</p>
<p>Around 2016, <a href="Anna_Limón" class="wikilink"
title="Anna Limón">Anna Limón</a> discovers a box of letters from Luna
in <a href="Sally_Martin" class="wikilink" title="Sally Martin">Sally
Martin</a>'s attic. Each letter is sealed with a kiss. When Sally is
taken to the hospital, she tells Anna she had tried to save Luna, years
before. Anna later speculates that Luna was the "hare of the moon" and
the woman who had "bad, bad fortune" in the various writings she had
found throughout <a href="The_House" class="wikilink"
title="The House">The House</a>. In <a href="Episode_Eight:_Freeze"
class="wikilink" title="The Freeze">The Freeze</a>, Luna comes to the
House to take Anna down under the hill.</p>
<h2 id="season_two">Season Two</h2>
<p>Anna says that when she was brought into the Underhill she was not
able to look Luna in the eye. We also learn that Luna was the consort of
<a href="the_King" class="wikilink" title="the King">the King</a>; she
is commonly referred to as his pet in story canon. Mabel again mentions
breaking the mirrors in order to hide from Luna again in <em><a
href="Episode_Fifteen:_Killing_the_Moon" class="wikilink"
title="Killing the Moon">Killing the Moon</a></em>.</p>
<h2 id="seasons_three_four">Seasons Three &amp; Four</h2>
<p>In <em>Unusual Hungers</em>, Mabel tells Anna the story of Luna; she
was, at some point, created (as the moon) in order to (complicatedly?)
combat and feed the darkness. At some point, Luna and Sally met and
became close. Sally did not truly understand Luna, however, and at some
point, Sally-- overwhelmed by the thought of leaving her entire life
behind-- ran from Luna and married her <a href="Esau" class="wikilink"
title="husband">husband</a>. Sally thus broke her promise to save Luna,
and left Luna to rot in the Underhill.</p>
<p>Within season three, Luna creates <a href="Veratrine"
class="wikilink" title="Veratrine">Veratrine</a> to take Anna's place in
the upper world. When Anna, Mabel, and Veratrine travel to the Court,
they find Luna kneeling at the foot of the King; Veratrine, terrified,
explains that she usually spends her time beating at the bars of her
cage. With Luna now as a model inmate, the trio of irreverent miscreants
quickly realize they need to escape back to the House.</p>
<p>Luna and Veratrine have dueling narratives in <em>Matryoshka</em>; it
is revealed to the audience at this point that Luna created Vera. She
asks if creating Veratrine is, in two senses, like being a mother or
like being in love. It is also revealed that the King found Luna in a
field of flowers.</p>
<p>Luna and Veratrine have a discussion in <em>Temporal Snake;</em> it
ends with the two of them deciding to run away together.</p>
<h2 id="season_six">Season Six</h2>
<p>Luna presides over Anna's coronation to Kingship; she is the
speaker/preist who has Mabel pledge herself to Anna. Anna and Mabel
discuss Luna's and the King's relationship, and it is revealed that they
were in no way romantically involved with each other, their relationship
more resembling a business partnership. She broke a promise, and the
King held her to it. That is all.</p>
<p>Luna Thorne is dead; long live Luna Thorne.</p>
<h2 id="season_seven">Season Seven</h2>
<p>Veratrine says that Luna has been "torn apart and torn asunder". It
can be assumed they've broken up.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<ul>
<li>As Luna's partner, <a href="Veratrine" class="wikilink"
title="Veratrine">Veratrine</a>, is written by <a href="Maybell_Marten"
class="wikilink" title="Maybell Marten">Maybell Marten</a>, it can be
assumed that Luna is written by <a href="Becca_De_La_Rosa"
class="wikilink" title="Becca De La Rosa">Becca De La Rosa</a>. While
this has never been confirmed, it does explain why Luna's monologues
resemble Anna's moreso than Mabel's.</li>
<li>According to <a href="Episode_Seven:_King_in_the_Labyrinth"
class="wikilink" title="King in the Labyrinth">King in the Labyrinth</a>
and <a href="Episode_Thirty-Nine:_Reverie" class="wikilink"
title="Reverie">Reverie</a>, Luna has scars all over her face.</li>
<li>Luna, as the girl in Mabel's mirror, took the place Anna should have
had (as usually, the love of the Martin girl's life is in their mirror.
See <a href="Juniper" class="wikilink"
title="Juniper">Juniper</a>).</li>
<li>She has some fondness for Mabel, as is clear in season six.</li>
