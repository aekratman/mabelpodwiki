Esau is a character mentioned throughout *Mabel*.

## All Seasons {#all_seasons}

Esau is [Mabel Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink}\'s
grandfather, [Lily Martin](Lily_Martin "Lily Martin"){.wikilink}\'s
father, and [Sally Martin](Sally_Martin "Sally Martin"){.wikilink}\'s
husband. None of them took his last name, which is unknown. Little is
known about him beyond the fact that he is dead (see
[Pilgrimage](Episode_Eleven:_Pilgrimage "Pilgrimage"){.wikilink}, in
which Anna states that he is buried next to Lily).

His name presumably references the biblical
[Esau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esau), who is the older brother of
Jacob. Jacob uses deception to steal Esau\'s birthright and Esau vows to
kill him.
