## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Anna calls Mabel and explains that she got her number from a friend of a
friend. She explains that she\'s not calling because something bad has
happened to Sally, Mabel\'s grandmother, only because she has a
question. After three days without receiving an answer, Anna calls
again. This goes on for some time until Anna finally realizes Mabel will
not answer, but decides to plow on anyway. She explains that the
previous week (maybe Monday or Tuesday) Sally asked Anna to go up in the
attic to get a box of Christmas lights with the word *\'1986*\' written
on the side. Anna finds the box and brings it downstairs for Sally
without opening it.

Sally opens the box in the kitchen, but when she opens it, she starts
screaming \' like a fox, something inhuman\'. Anna throws the box to the
ground. Eventually, Sally starts saying \"I'm going into the ground for
you,\" over and over again. Anna gets the sense that it means something
important.

Anna waits until Sally falls asleep before going downstairs to see
what\'s in the box. The box is filled with letters, hundreds or even
thousands of then, bundled into packets and tied with red and white
butcher\'s twine. All of them are in the same envelope with a navy-blue
stripe across the top and with the same \'scribbled, uneven
handwriting\'. Each one is stamped with a red stamp that reads
*\'Returned to Sender*\', but not a single on of them is opened. They
are all addressed to Sally Martin, \'at this house, at this address\'.
Each is sealed with a red lipstick kiss.

The episode ends abruptly when Mabel\'s voicemail box fills up.
