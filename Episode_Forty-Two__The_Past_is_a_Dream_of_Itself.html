<ul>
<li>Unreality, death, distortion, loud noises, dissasociation,
references to abuse (physical and emotional), references to
starvation/captivity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="episode_summary">Episode Summary</h2>
<p>This episode begins with [ Lolo](Eidolon_García ” Lolo”){.wikilink}
explaining part of her backstory. When she was eight, she began
experiencing dehabilitating nightmares. Her mother and abuelita took her
to see a man named Doctor Camino, who told her that she'd never lose the
pain she's experiencing, that death has a weakness for her, and that
she'd spend her entire life chasing ghosts. Lolo remarks that he wasn't
wrong about any of it.</p>
<p>We cut to Mabel and Anna, looking at what the King has become (an
"uninhibited sharp tangle of... darkness"). They discuss how they don't
know what's going on, but Mabel knows that "something is ill" in the
Hill. Back with the ghostbusters, Lolo and Janet discuss how Lolo's GPS
is broken. They arrive at Lolo's gas station, and Anna asks which world
they're in. Janet talks about Sally, and Anna says she's asking about
before that time-- Janet asks if she's talking about what happened in
the twenties, and Anna asks what she means, at which point Lolo cuts
Janet off, telling her it doesn't matter what occurred back then. Janet
ends up asking if Anna is really herself, and Anna explains that she
hasn't truly been gone for three years-- she's been stuck in the weave
of that time, explaining that it felt longer than three years. Janet
tells Anna she's sorry that that happened to her.</p>
<p>We cut to <a href="Jonathan_Mills" class="wikilink"
title="Jonathan Mills">Jonathan Mills</a>. He says that the tape we're
listening to is a contingency plan, and if anyone is listening, he may
be dead. He renounces loyalty to Aurora Silver and says that, while he
is not a true believer, he has scientific proof of supernatural
occurrences that remind him of "pathogens". He says he has watched these
pathogens (presumably something from the Hill) carve subjects "up from
the inside out." He calls Aurora Silver similar to a political extremist
and explains that one of his coworkers, Brandon, was killed because of a
mistake that Jonathan himself made, despite Brandon's loyalty to the
cause. Jonathan says he used to believe Aurora Silver thought he was
special, but he knows he was wrong; and she is now becoming more
erratic, making mistakes. He says he's going to wait for something--
either his own death or a chance to make all the deaths of the other
cultists mean something.</p>
<p>We then hear from <a href="Mabel?" class="wikilink"
title="Mabel?">Mabel?</a>, who says she is going to unstitch whoever
she's speaking to from someone else. The end of this piece of the
episode comes when Mabel? says "Put on your dancing shoes. The music is
about to become very, very loud."</p>
<p>Back with Anna and Mabel, Anna says she's found Sally's old journal.
After discussing boundaries with Mabel, Mabel asks Anna to tell her what
the journal says. The journal explains that Sally and her brother,
Phillip, knew Luna Thorne when they were children. Phillip died in the
Battle of Midway. Mabel explains that she knew that because she'd found
his death telegram when she was a teenager, and Sally had locked her up
for it. Anna says she wishes she'd gotten to kill Sally, and Mabel and
Anna have a brief, enjoyable side about being in love before we return
to the journal. Anna reads that Sally had found out Luna's true name.
Mabel interrupts that Luna does not have a true name, but Anna continues
that Sally found a ritual called "On the Basis of Exchange". Anna then
asks why Mabel knows that Luna doesn't have a true name, and Mabel
rpelies that "there are too many of us in here" ("here" presumably being
in Luna). Anna keeps going, explaining that Sally used the ritual to
swap claims with Luna. While Luna claimed her freedom, Sally stole her
freedom back and then claimed the power of life and death. Anna says
that Sally wanted to use the power to rebirth Phillip, and Mabel,
shocked, replies "...Lily?"</p>
