The subjects of [Aurora
Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink} are various people who
have gone through the cult inflicting [The
King](The_King "The King"){.wikilink} on normal civilians. She
presumably uses them to attempt to find the King.

## Subject 7825 {#subject_7825}

7825 was [Mabel Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink}\'s
designation during her time at [El Segundo
Academy](El_Segundo_Academy "El Segundo Academy"){.wikilink}. While
little is known about the experiments she went through, it is clear that
they were painful. At one point, they run an experiment only for
Mabel\'s voicemail to echo over and over, steadily distorting.[^1]

## Subject 6163 {#subject_6163}

6163 was [Ekaterina
Roskova](Ekaterina_Roskova "Ekaterina Roskova"){.wikilink}\'s
designation during her time at [Saint Olga\'s
Preparatory](Saint_Olga's_Preparatory "Saint Olga's Preparatory"){.wikilink}.
She was tortured until she forgot her name, and eventually summoned some
form of god after reciting a
[prophecy](Aconite's_Prophecy "prophecy"){.wikilink}. After she summoned
the god, she died and went into the Underhill, becoming
[Aconite](Aconite "Aconite"){.wikilink} and experiencing total amnesia
of her life before until [the
girls](Anna_&_Mabel "the girls"){.wikilink} played her one of the tapes
of her torture. She regained her memories and Mabel told her Aurora
Silver would be looking for her, and that she should not leave the
[House](The_House "House"){.wikilink} for fear of death.[^2]

## Tressa Davies {#tressa_davies}

While she has no designation, [Tressa
Davies](Tressa_Davies "Tressa Davies"){.wikilink} was often summoned by
Aurora Silver to complete small tasks (such as describing her emotions
when holding certain things), counting her as a subject during her time
at [Lang Primary Conservatory for the
Disabled](Lang_Primary_Conservatory_for_the_Disabled "Lang Primary Conservatory for the Disabled"){.wikilink}.[^3]

## Subject 4583 {#subject_4583}

4583 has no known true name. His test held him screaming and,
eventually, his screams turned to stag calls before wet splatting which
sounds like a body exploding played. It can be assumed he is dead.[^4]

## Subject 5712 {#subject_5712}

4583 has no known true name. Their test involves them hollowly repeating
the words \"It\'s really you. I missed you so much.\" over and over.
Their fate is unknown.[^5]

## Subject 1138 {#subject_1138}

1138 has no known true name. Their test involved them apparently
shape-shifting (making infant wailing noises into loud, adult laughter
and distorted screams) before they say \"[Fiat justitia et ruat
caelum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_justitia_ruat_caelum)\"
(\"Let justice be done though the heavens fall\", meaning that justice
must be served \"regardless of consequences\"). Their fate is
unknown.[^6]
