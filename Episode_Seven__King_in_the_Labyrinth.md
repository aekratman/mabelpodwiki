**Trigger Warnings:**

- Distortion, unreality, injury, manipulation, death.

## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Anna\'s voicemail plays for the first time, and Mabel greets her, saying
that she\'d received her message. She tells her the parts of the House
she should avoid, and then the phone cuts off. It comes back to Mabel
having a conversation with someone unknown about generalizing herself.
She delivers maybe the most kickass line in the whole first season (\"I
am not *moon* and *mirror*, I am flesh and bone, see? Do you see where
I\--\", though the author of this wiki is also partial to \"Strange,
maybe, but not strangers.\"). It cuts off to Mabel singing *[The Stolen
Child](https://poets.org/poem/stolen-child)* by W.B. Yeats. It cuts off
to Mabel asking the unknown voice if Anna can hear her, citing The
Rules.

It cuts off again and Mabel begins talking to herself about the [girl in
the mirror](Luna_Thorne "girl in the mirror"){.wikilink} she knew as a
kid. She then tells Anna a story about the time a fox bit her as a
child, ending it with saying that sometimes, when you think someone is
in pain and you want to help, they just want to hurt you. She says that
she has not been her real self for a long time, and that Anna needs the
protection of the house (which isn\'t haunted, but definitely is a
haunting). It cuts off for the last time and she tells Anna to make a
yoke out of what the house loves in order to make it fear her so that it
will listen to her.

## Continuity

**`<small>`{=html}Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.`</small>`{=html}**

- Mabel telling Anna to make a yoke out of what the House loves is
  ironic, because the House loves Mabel more than anything.
- She\'s presumably talking to [the
  King](the_King "the King"){.wikilink} the whole time.
- The Stolen Child is about a changeling, which calls back to when Lily
  saw Mabel outside of herself one day as a child; though the creators
  have
  [confirmed](https://mabelpodcast.tumblr.com/post/611311659049418752/hi-girls-just-out-of-curiosity-i-dont-think)
  Mabel isn\'t quite a changeling, but something more complex.\
