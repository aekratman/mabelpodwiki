<p><strong>Episode description:</strong> Who is the daughter of the king
under the hill? </p>
<h2 id="episode_overview">Episode Overview</h2>
<p>Everything goes to hell.</p>
<h4 id="trigger_warnings"><strong>Trigger Warnings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Screaming, distortion, panic/anxiety attacks, unreality, injury,
abuse mentions and flashbacks, pain, disassociation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="episode_summary">Episode Summary</h2>
<p>After <a href="Aconite" class="wikilink" title="Aconite">Aconite</a>
crashes the party and claims her right to the throne, <a
href="Anna_Limón" class="wikilink" title="Anna">Anna</a> and <a
href="Mabel_Martin" class="wikilink" title="Mabel">Mabel</a> freak out,
Mabel insisting she must have been lying about her parentage. Anna stops
her by saying that they need to <em>go</em>.</p>
<p>We cut over to <a href="Janet_Kirk" class="wikilink"
title="Janet">Janet</a>, who explains to her audience that her tape
recorder was stolen from her hands and dragged away, leading Janet into
a gigantic room with a triple window covered in ivy. The ivy is spread
out in strange patterns, along with datura pods everywhere. She whispers
"oh my god--" before the entire thing cuts away, back to the girls.</p>
<p>Anna tries to fix Mabel's arm, while Mabel continues to panic. The
two of them discuss Aconite's possible parentage, Mabel insisting that
Luna could not be her mother because the <a href="The_King"
class="wikilink" title="King">King</a> and <a href="Luna_Thorne"
class="wikilink" title="Luna">Luna</a>'s relationship was very
business-like, with no fondness between them. The King's only hope-- his
only joy in the whole of himself, which Mabel saw during the fight in <a
href="Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake" class="wikilink"
title="Temporal Snake">Temporal Snake</a>-- was Mabel herself.</p>
<p>They discuss how the King never tried to hurt Mabel on purpose, and
Anna apologizes for taking Mabel out of the hill without her permission.
Mabel has a brief moment of confusion over someone caring about her
autonomy, before Luna stops in, being dramatic and strutting out after
saying she doesn't envy the girls for what is to come.</p>
<p>The episode cuts briefly to a cult tape recording of a subject
referred to as 1138. An infant wails before Aurora Silver asks if that's
what 1138 expects to affect her, and the baby's screaming changes to
terrifying laughter. 1138 says "Fiat justitia et ruat caelum" in a
distorted voice before it cuts to Aconite, having a panic attack, trying
to remind herself that the King is her father. She repeats "I know who I
am" to herself several times.</p>
<p>Mabel and Anna decide that they have to somehow best Aconite in order
to gain the throne back properly. Anna asks if Mabel is jealous of
Aconite, because the King was her only father figure. They have a good
strong discussion on their feelings; afterward, Mabel accidentally finds
the tape recordings Anna finds in Reactionary Politics or Primogeniture
I'll check in a minute. Mabel hears the recordings of herself when she
was subject 7825, and begins to panic. She explains that Aurora Silver
used to inflict the King of the Underhill on normal people; calming
herself down, she hears a different tape begin to play, and laughs,
realizing the House was trying to help.<br />
==Continuity== <strong><small>Please note that this section contains
spoilers for later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own
risk.</small></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The tape Mabel hears at the end is of Aconite-- or, in this case, <a
href="Ekaterina_Roskova" class="wikilink" title="Subject 6163">Subject
6163</a>-- in one of Aurora Silver's tests.</li>
<li>The King being Mabel's adopted father is relevant to the overall way
Luna treats Mabel along with the reason Mabel was able to win in
Temporal Snake.</li>
<li>Janet presumably finds the window on the third floor that Mabel
warned Anna not to look in during <a
href="Episode_Seven:_King_in_the_Labyrinth" class="wikilink"
title="King in the Labyrinth.">King in the Labyrinth.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<p><small><strong>Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.</strong></small></p>
<ul>
<li>Fiat justitia ruat caelum-- properly written as "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_justitia_ruat_caelum">fīat
jūstitia ruat cælum</a>" is a Latin phrase which means "Let justice be
done though the heavens fall." It refers to the belief that justice
should be and must be served regardless of any consequence.</li>
<li>Subject 1138 is presumably a shapeshifter, which is why they can
switch their voice. This, however, is not confirmed.</li>
<li>1138, run through the A1Z26 cypher, is "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aach_(toponymy)">Aach</a>."
Apparently that is a German term for running water. It may be a reach,
but hey, who knows!</li>
