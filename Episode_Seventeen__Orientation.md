## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Mabel arrives back in the house after Anna swapped their places in the
previous episode. Mabel speaks to Anna (through her phone) about the
struggles she\'s facing adjusting to the \'real\' world. She mentions
that time works differently under the hill and that she cannot use her
stubbornness or other matters of willpower to get what she wants up
here. She then discusses how the house is rearranging itself around her,
specifically putting the landline phone on the dining room table so she
can hear it ringing. She then gets very, very mad at Anna after picking
up the phone to find Anna\'s friend (a Miss Reyes) asking after her. She
says that she looked but never found Anna and then explains that she\'s
most likely being forced to sing for the Underhill in order to survive.
She ends the episode asking Anna who she truly is and then saying that
it doesn\'t matter\-- she loves her no matter who she is.\
