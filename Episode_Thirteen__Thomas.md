## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Thomas comes back to the House, explaining to Anna that he and

younger and he\'s [Mabel\'s](Mabel_Martin "Mabel's"){.wikilink} father.
He tells Anna the house is going to steal parts of her and to not
discuss any plans she has to break Mabel out, before telling her in
Spanish to find a door in order to get to Mabel.

## Trivia

`<small>`{=html}**Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.**`</small>`{=html}

- Thomas is the only paternal figure in Mabel\'s life (save for,
  perhaps, the [hound](The_King "hound"){.wikilink} and
  [hare](Luna_Thorne "hare"){.wikilink}) that wanted her. Because Mabel
  does not get to be happy, apparently, he was never able to see her.
- Thomas says the House does not want the Martins happy; however, the
  House *does* want Mabel, at least, to be happy, so long as she
  doesn\'t leave.
- In episode 39, Anna mentions knowing Mabel\'s father\'s name. Mabel,
  in that universe, is at least be aware of her father and what happened
  to him. In the canonical universe, she doesn\'t appear to be.
