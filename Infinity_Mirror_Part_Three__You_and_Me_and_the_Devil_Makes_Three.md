## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Tressa explains that her phone isn\'t working at all before talking
about her plane ride to Ireland, where she met a woman named
[Maebh](Maebh "Maebh"){.wikilink}. Maebh shared her candy with Tressa
and watched over her as she slept, even showing up in Tressa\'s dreams,
where she tells her "We've heard the reverberations even here, such is
the gravity of [their](Anna_&_Mabel "their"){.wikilink} choice; so
greatly have we been untethered from our own axes."

She checks the instructions list and is told to go look in a kitchen
cupboard, where she finds the same brand of candy Maebh gave her on the
plane ride. Then she talks about [Becca De La
Rosa](Becca_De_La_Rosa "Becca De La Rosa"){.wikilink}. Tressa says that
Becca sounds very different from Anna, because Becca sounds genuinely
joyful while Anna seems to just be slogging through life. After Tressa
rambles for a while about time, death, and sewing, she moves down the
list. The next instruction is to pick up the phone, which suddenly rings
just as she reads it.

She picks it up and hears her future self remind her again to remember
the mourning dove, and after calming herself down from a panic, she
follows the next step of the instruction paper and talks about a time
she made a bargain. She explains that when she attended [Lang Primary
Conservatory for the
Disabled](Lang_Primary_Conservatory_for_the_Disabled "Lang Primary Conservatory for the Disabled"){.wikilink},
a bully in her class, [Larissa
Knight](Larissa_Knight "Larissa Knight"){.wikilink}, wore a ring that
Tressa wanted. Tressa challenges her to a game of hopscotch and, during
her turn, trips purposefully, before saying Larissa stole her ring.
Larissa gets in trouble with their principal, Lara Ouvriers, and Tressa
keeps the ring for the rest of her life.

The final instruction that Tressa reads is to check her voicemail. She
does so reluctantly and finds one left in her inbox. It\'s from Becca
and [Maybell](Maybell_Marten "Maybell"){.wikilink}. Becca quite cheerily
tells her there\'s absolutely nothing to fear from
[Sally](Sally_Martin "Sally"){.wikilink}\'s
[house](The_House "house"){.wikilink}, and Maybell, laughing, tells her
that she\'d messed up\-- it\'s not Sally\'s house, it\'s her
grandmother\'s. Becca, however, drops the act and reveals herself and
Maybell to be Anna and Mabel. Anna tells Tressa she\'s trapped in the
House due to signing a contract, and she has to fulfill her end of the
bargain to get out. Mabel tells her goodbye and Anna tells her good
luck, and\-- still laughing\-- they hang up the phone.

## Continuity

**`<small>`{=html}Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.`</small>`{=html}**

- Lara Ouvriers is presumably an alias for [Aurora
  Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}.
- Thus, Tressa\'s school is the fourth \"cult school\" ran by [Aurora
  Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}. The other three are
  [El Segundo
  Academy](El_Segundo_Academy "El Segundo Academy"){.wikilink}, [Green
  Pines](Green_Pines "Green Pines"){.wikilink}, and [Saint Olga\'s
  Preparatory](Saint_Olga's_Preparatory "Saint Olga's Preparatory"){.wikilink}.
- \"Becca and Maybell\" also run the podcast\'s social media in
  character as their Infinity Mirror selves. It is appropriately
  terrifying.
- Tressa\'s story about her time in school is reminiscent of
  [Jonathan](Jonathan_Mills "Jonathan"){.wikilink}\'s from [The
  Consort](Episode_Thirty:_The_Consort "The Consort"){.wikilink}.
