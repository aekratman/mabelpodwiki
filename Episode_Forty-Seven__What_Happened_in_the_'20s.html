<p>In which old actors tell a new story. Right? Featuring: two girls in
a haunted house on a hill.</p>
<p><strong>Episode description:</strong> Have you heard this story
before? </p>
<h2 id="episode_overview">Episode Overview</h2>
<p>A shadow tells a faery tale.</p>
<h4 id="trigger_warnings"><strong>Trigger Warnings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Unreality, distortion, arguing, screaming.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="episode_summary">Episode Summary</h2>
<p>The episode begins with <a href="Mabel?" class="wikilink"
title="Mabel?">Mabel?</a> reciting a nursery-rhyme like poem about a
king and a queen (presumably, by description, representing <a
href="Luna_Thorne" class="wikilink" title="Luna Thorne">Luna Thorne</a>
and the <a href="The_King" class="wikilink" title="King">King</a>). She
begins to tell a story about two girls-- <a href="Katriona"
class="wikilink" title="Katriona">Katriona</a> and <a href="Res"
class="wikilink" title="Res">Res</a>-- who have broken into the Martin
House in the 1920s. Katriona is an heiress of some fortune and is prone
to strange fantasies. Res is her friend who takes care of her; we are
introduced to these girls by Res telling Kat to be careful due to
strange noises in the house.</p>
<p>The two of them discuss their friend <a href="Betsy" class="wikilink"
title="Betsy">Betsy</a>, who puts on fake haunted parties. Kat calls
herself a connoisseur of the dead, and Res asks Kat if they're going to
eat the dead. They find a vine of brugsmansia, which spells something
out. Kat begins to sketch it and breaks something. Res says they're
going to be caught as delinquents, and Kat tells her what happened in
the House: the family fled, presumably due to a scandal. They find a
strange painting, which both of them see very differently. Kat sees a
woman laughing with a cicada in her throat and a man "green like the
summer" looking at her. Res sees a woman with a silk moth in her throat
looking solemn, and a man made of shadows. These two seem to represent
Mabel and Anna's views of Luna and the King, seeing as Kat is played by
<a href="Maybell_Marten" class="wikilink" title="Maybell Marten">Maybell
Marten</a> and Res is played by <a href="Becca_De_La_Rosa"
class="wikilink" title="Becca De La Rosa">Becca De La Rosa</a>.</p>
<p>They discuss spiders and death, and Kat says she feels like she knows
the people in the painting, as if they are a footpath in and out of the
House. After the girls fight, Kat threathens to stay in the house alone,
interrupting Res by yelling "three, seven, ace!" Kat screams that the
door is going to open, and both girls become scared, Res saying that she
takes it back before a swarm of insect noises overwhelm the soundscape.
Mabel? returns, asking if the story was something like that.</p>
<h2 id="continuity">Continuity</h2>
<p><strong><small>Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.</small></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This episode continues the trend of the seventh episode of each full
season taking place outside the normal realm of the season (see Mabel's
appearances in <a href="Episode_Seven:_King_in_the_Labyrinth"
class="wikilink" title="King in the Labyrinth">King in the Labyrinth</a>
and <a href="Episode_Fifteen:_Killing_the_Moon" class="wikilink"
title="Killing the Moon">Killing the Moon</a>, Anna's appearance in <a
href="Episode_Twenty-Three:_Bull_in_the_Maze" class="wikilink"
title="Bull in the Maze">Bull in the Maze</a>, the King's possession of
Anna in <a href="Episode_Thirty-One:_The_King_Speaks" class="wikilink"
title="The King Speaks">The King Speaks</a>, and the multiverse
expansion in <a href="Episode_Thirty-Nine:_Reverie" class="wikilink"
title="Reverie">Reverie</a>). Kat and Res may thus be read as other
versions of Mabel and Anna.</li>
<li>Kat's King being "green like the summer" continues the canon facet
of the King's transformation according to the seasons.</li>
<li>"The door is going to open!" relates to both <a href="Thomas"
class="wikilink" title="Thomas">Thomas</a> and <a href="Jonathan_Mills"
class="wikilink" title="Jonathan">Jonathan</a>'s death monologues, along
with mirroring Anna's riddles in <a href="Episode_Sixteen:_Underworld"
class="wikilink" title="Underworld">Underworld</a>.</li>
<li>Kat sees a looping brugmansia vine, and the two girls mimic Jonathan
and Brandon's exchange in <a href="Episode_Forty-Four:_Ashes,_Ashes"
class="wikilink" title="Ashes, Ashes">Ashes, Ashes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trivia">Trivia</h2>
<p><small><strong>Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.</strong></small></p>
<ul>
<li>"Three, seven, ace!" is a line from the book The Queen of Spades by
Alexander Pushkin. It concerns a man who wishes to obtain a secret to
win at gambling, and thus works with a ghost to find it. Kat says it
often, and appears to enjoy the book.</li>
<li>Kat's name means "pure"; it comes from the same root as <a
href="Ekaterina_Roskova" class="wikilink"
title="Ekaterina">Ekaterina</a>. Res means "red-headed".</li>
<li>We never <em>really</em> learn what exactly happened in the
twenties, but it can be assumed that Kat and Res went missing in the
"real world."<br />
