<p>In which we encounter our own reflections. Featuring: a new voice, a
new place, an old situation.</p>
<p><strong>Episode description:</strong> Mabel's back for season five!
Remember that big competition we held over the break? You don't? Let us
jog your memory. </p>
<h2 id="episode_overview">Episode Overview</h2>
<p>A new sacrifice arrives in the <a href="The_House" class="wikilink"
title="Manor By The Sea">Manor By The Sea</a>.</p>
<h4 id="trigger_warnings"><strong>Trigger Warnings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Distortion, static, glitching, unreality, poison, mention of
death.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="episode_summary">Episode Summary</h2>
<p>The episode begins with <a href="Becca_De_La_Rosa" class="wikilink"
title="Becca De La Rosa">Becca De La Rosa</a> and <a
href="Maybell_Marten" class="wikilink" title="Mabel Martin">Mabel
Martin</a> announcing a competition they ran, in which one listener
would be randomly selected to stay overnight at the house which inspired
the show. In Infinity Mirror's canon, the house was referred to as
belonging to Becca's grandmother.</p>
<p>Next, we hear from the winner of the competition and the main
character of the season: <a href="Tressa_Davies" class="wikilink"
title="Tressa Davies">Tressa Davies</a>. She seems incredibly nervous,
but explains the rules of the competition: she has to record the night
she stays in the house, and she has a list of topics she needs to talk
about. The first two things on the list are to tell the audience about
herself and to head upstairs and to look in a. certain room before
describing what she sees. As she's heading upstairs, she says the
following: she's from Ithaca, New York, is a college dropout who
formerly studied medieval history, and she has cats. She has no idea
what she wants to do with her life. As she walks up the stairs, she
explains that she has a condition called Nemaline Myopathy, so she might
take a while to get up the stairs due to her difficulty with
mobility.</p>
<p>In order to have something to talk about while she goes up the
stairs, she goes to the third question on the instruction seat, which
asks about a time in childhood she'd understood true fear. She talks
about a time when she was six-- she found a yew tree and met a big black
bird who offered her some berries from the tree. She ate them, realized
she was going to die (every part of the yew tree, discounting the red
covering of the seeds, is poisonous), but her mother found her and got
her to a hospital. She survived.</p>
<p>She reaches the top of the stairs and finds a typewriter, which
unscrolls a paper so she can see that it reads “A BLACK-EYED BIRD WITH A
MOUTHFUL OF BERRIES TRIED TO SING HER DOWN UNDER THE GROUND.”</p>
<p>The episode ends.</p>
