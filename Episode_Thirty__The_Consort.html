<h2 id="episode_overview">Episode Overview</h2>
<p>Various consorts of various kings have their say.</p>
<h4 id="trigger_warnings"><strong>Trigger Warnings</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Abuse, manipulation, cults, homophobia, violence, bullying, arguing,
screaming.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="episode_summary">Episode Summary</h2>
<p><a href="Mabel_Martin" class="wikilink" title="Mabel">Mabel</a>
explains to <a href="Anna_LimÃ³n" class="wikilink" title="Anna">Anna</a>
how to beat <a href="The_King" class="wikilink" title="The King">The
King</a> (by challenging him through ritual) and they head back down to
the Hill after Mabel convinces Vera to stick around. They promise the
House they'll come back when they're done.</p>
<p>We cut to <a href="The_Unknown_Voices" class="wikilink"
title="The Unknown Voices">The Unknown Voices</a>, one of them ( <a
href="Jonathan_Mills" class="wikilink" title="Jonathan">Jonathan</a>)
screaming at the others, shutting down the camera feed so they're alone
and not being watched by the "Exclave." He tells the other two the story
of how he was recruited into the cult-- he grew up rich, starting making
trouble, and got sent to a boarding school called <a href="Green_Pines"
class="wikilink" title="Green Pines">Green Pines</a>. It was there that
he met <a href="Aurora_Silver" class="wikilink"
title="Aurora Silver">Aurora Silver</a>, who told him she'd put him to
good use. After being attacked by a bully-- Hunter-- who meant to kill
him, Jonathan was saved by Aurora Silver, who killed Hunter and then
made the circumstances of hiss death completely disappear. Jonathan
shouts that there are no laws or rules that apply to her before the feed
turns back on and he stops his story.</p>
<p>We bounce back to the girls, who are back under the hill, meeting a
Court member named <a href="Court_Folk" class="wikilink"
title="Spindrift">Spindrift</a> who is being possessed by <a
href="Luna_Thorne" class="wikilink" title="Luna Thorne">Luna Thorne</a>.
Mabel and Luna have a conversation in which Luna explains that the King
is requesting an audience with the three of them. After Luna leaves,
Anna and Mabel have an argument about Mabel considering herself more
faerie than human. Anna finally explains what Vera had meant when she
referred to her as a murderer; when she was in college, she snapped the
connection she had with a girl who appeared to her in dreams/visions.
This girl, of course, was Mabel. This was because she was terrified of
her own strangness; Anna regrets it immensly and Mabel makes her promise
to never separate the two of them again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Luna and Veratrine meet for the first time, and Veratrine
says that the only thing she thinks will taste like liberty is Luna
herself.</p>
<p>Mabel makes Anna promise that she'll never do anything like that
again, even if something happens to her, and they both apologize. The
episode ends with Mabel saying "Let's go gut a tyrant."</p>

<ul>
<li>Aurora Silver is <a
href="https://mabelpodcast.tumblr.com/post/643856188948267009/anyway-aurora-silver-and-anna-parallel-each-other">canonically</a>
a parallel of Anna and the King, so the fact that no rules apply to her
is a cause for major concern, seeing as the only way Anna and Mabel
managed to kill the King was through rules and ritual.</li>
<li>Anna snapping her connection with Mabel could symbolize a literal
"snapping of the thread" because of her place in the <a

<ul>
<li>"The Consort" as a title can refer to three people involved in this
episode: Luna, Mabel, and Jonathan.</li>
<li>This is Veratrine and Luna's first face-to-face conversation.
Veratrine only uses nicknames for Luna, and Luna only uses Vera's full
name. Because Luna was given her name unwillingly and Veratrine chose
her own, there's interesting symbolism involved there.</li>
<li>Spindrift is an example of Luna being able to possess bodies, a
power she apparently has just like the King.</li>
