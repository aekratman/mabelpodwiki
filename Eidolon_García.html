<br />
</p>

<p>Eidolon 'Lolo' García is played by <a href="Reina_Roman"
class="wikilink" title="Reina Roman">Reina Roman</a>. She is a secondary
protagonist in season seven of <em>Mabel.</em></p>
<h2 id="season_seven">Season Seven</h2>
<p>After beginning to have physically harmful and mentally terrifying
dreams when she was eight, Lolo's mother and abuelita took her to see a
doctor/healer. His name was <a href="Doctor_Camino" class="wikilink"
title="Doctor Camino">Doctor Camino</a>; he ran a botanical shop
somewhere in East LA. He told Lolo that death had a weakness for her and
that she would spend her entire life "chasing ghosts". In her adulthood,
she becomes an amateur detective, looking for strange &amp; unusual
cases.</p>
<p>When she was twelve, she tried to save a teenage spirit who was stuck
in a death-loop. She managed it after praying over him for hours, but he
did not want to escape his loop, and she has had to live with that
mistake since.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In the modern timeline, where she is in her late 20s, Lolo arrives to
the house to find <a href="Janet_Kirk" class="wikilink"
title="Janet">Janet</a>; Lolo is the one who brought Janet into the
Martin House mystery. Janet had just found <a href="Anna_Limón"
class="wikilink" title="Anna Limón">Anna Limón</a>; Lolo tells Janet
that the woman she found is not Anna, and performs a spell on her:
"Contenerla, atala, protégela" (meaning "contain her, bind her, protect
her"). Anna passes out and they take her in Lolo's car to a gas station
Lolo lives in, which she refers to as a base of operations.</p>
<p>On the drive to the gas station, Janet asks Lolo if she is a witch,
and says she didn't think what she told her about the house was true.
Lolo gets offended and tells Janet that she's just a tourist, and that
she has no respect for the forces she's messing with. She is opposed to
Janet comparing their situation to a TV show, and does not believe that
stories can affect reality.</p>
<p>When Anna wakes up, Lolo introduces herself and Janet and tells a
story about a rigged card game. Anna asks Eidolon if she's a bruja, to
which she answers that she is a "fixer". Anna asks about Mabel's
whereabouts, and the forest splits.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> When they eventually do
make it to the gas station, Lolo tells Janet not to tell Anna about
something that happened at the Martin House, and they talk about who
Anna currently is.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Janet ends up spilling that Mabel has been dead in this timeline
since she was a child. Lolo brings Anna and Janet to Mabel's grave and
explains that she got into the mystery due to receiving a mysterious
email. Lolo then shows Anna various files she keeps on the Martin case,
including the hidden police description of a situation Mabel endured as
a child. Janet says she believes Lolo hacked the files in order to get
to them, but Lolo simply says that she's good at her job. She defines
her job as finding people like Anna and helping them while trying to
make sure no one is hurt in the process.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>She explains the context of <a href="What_Happened_At_El_Segundo"
class="wikilink" title="What Happened At El Segundo">What Happened At El
Segundo</a> to Anna with Janet's help.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>She later talks to Mabel about the teenage spirit she met, and
discusses her position as the opposing force to Mabel; order to chaos.
When they arrive at the Martin place, Lolo and Janet set up the ritual
to bring Mabel back, and Lolo leads the ritual. When it begins to fail,
Janet dies while attempting to yank Mabel out of the spiritual door as
Lolo screams at her to stop. Her current fate is unknown.</p>
