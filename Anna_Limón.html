<p><br />
Anna Limón is played by <a href="Becca_De_La_Rosa" class="wikilink"
title="Becca De La Rosa">Becca De La Rosa</a>. She is one of the two
main protagonists of <em>Mabel,</em> and is the main character for the
first two seasons.</p>
<h2 id="season_one">Season One</h2>
<p>Anna works as a live-in carer for <a href="Sally_Martin"
class="wikilink" title="Sally Martin">Sally Martin</a>, starting
somewhere around June of 2016. During this time, she finds a box of
letters in the attic of the Martin home, and upon Sally's terrified
reaction to it, she continuously attempts to call one <a
href="Mabel_Martin" class="wikilink" title="Mabel Martin">Mabel
Martin</a>, Sally's granddaughter.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Mabel never picks up,
but Anna continues to call her, telling her about her life and her time
as Mabel's grandmother's carer. When the voicemail box on Mabel's phone
is full, Anna tries calling again, only for it to be mysteriously
emptied.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Now aware that Mabel is not dead,
and can in fact hear her, Anna is reinvigorated to continue calling,
telling Mabel more and more of the day-to-day goings-on in the Martin
household.</p>
<p>Anna eventually tells Mabel about Sally's struggles. She speaks of
their daily routine and then tells Mabel about a dream that she had,
where she was stuck in a mall with another woman with a red mouth. The
woman mouthed a word at her-- she thinks it might have been
<em>penumbra</em> or <em>autumnal</em>. It is later revealed to have
been <em>datura</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Far too curious for her own good, Anna decides to attempt to open a
letter, bringing her phone with her so Mabel can be made into an
accomplice. As Anna opens one of the letters, she hears Sally fall, and
hangs up the phone.</p>
<p>The next day, Anna meets and speaks to the[ man in the street](Thomas
” man in the street”){.wikilink} for the first time, who asks her the
same thing three times and mouths at her to get out of the house<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. She also tells Mabel that Sally is
fine-- she fell out of bed before Anna had time to read the letters.
However, Anna did see two things; a return address to 'Fairy Hill,' and
a name on the envelope: '<a href="Luna_Thorne" class="wikilink"
title="Luna Thorne.">Luna Thorne.</a>'</p>
<p>Anna calls Mabel the next day and tells her that she's begun
researching in the library, trying to find the encyclopedia description
of datura. She finds an Encyclopedia Britannica, but when she reaches
the section datura should be in, she finds the pages ripped out. The
pages have been carved out to hold an EP record. The label is missing,
but written on it is "<a href="Hold_With_the_Hare,_Run_With_the_Hounds"
class="wikilink" title="hold with the hare">hold with the hare</a>."
When she plays the record, a blue bead falls out of the record player.
It's from a doll's dress, and when Anna finds the doll, she finds a <a
href="The_First_Riddle" class="wikilink" title="riddle">riddle</a>
tucked in her skirts<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As Anna begins to have strange dreams<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>,
she begins to wonder if Sally lies to her. When visiting the Martin
garden, she finds a wrecked old sign that reads <em>Fairy Hill</em><a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><em>.</em> She goes back to the
mushroom ring and finds them uprooted, as though they were bleeding.
Anna thinks about quitting and finds that, try as she might, she cannot
make herself leave.</p>
<p>The next time Anna calls Mabel, she talks to her about people who had
disappeared from King's County; her uncle <a href="Jack_Madrigal"
class="wikilink" title="Jack">Jack</a> and Mabel's mother, <a
href="Lily_Martin" class="wikilink" title="Lily">Lily</a>. As she's
talking, she realizes she has to go wake Sally up. When she gets to
Sally's room, however, she's missing. Anna eventually finds Sally in the
garden, wrapped in rose thorns and freezing cold, and takes her to the
hospital. As Sally lies half-delirious, she tells Anna that she'd tried
to save Luna Thorne.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Anna gets trapped inside the House's spell, stuck in an empty world
with no way to contact the outside. The season ends with Luna Thorne
bringing her down to the Hill to see Mabel.</p>
<h2 id="season_two">Season Two</h2>
<p>We hear nothing from Anna in the first episode of the new season, but
her sister <a href="Monica_Jenkins" class="wikilink"
title="Mona">Mona</a> calls her several times. She never responds. She
is reported missing by Mona about a week after she disappears.</p>
<p>In the season's second episode, Anna returns to the Martin house,
talking to the walls as if they are Mabel. When she asks Mabel to make
noise, the lights buzz, suggesting that Mabel is stuck inside the house
itself. She tells Mabel that she was only gone for about an afternoon,
but everyone else believes she was missing for days. Anna speaks about
being brought down into the Underhill, where she met Mabel for the first
time. She then gets a call from the hospital staff, who tells her that
Sally had passed away while she was under the Hill. Anna and Mabel
discuss Sally's death, before Mabel begins to make the lights in the
house buzz uncontrollably. Anna asks if it's "him," and when Mabel
confirms it, she tells Mabel a story about her nephew, <a
href="Aaron_Jenkins" class="wikilink" title="Aaron">Aaron</a>, to calm
her down. She then asks Mabel to stay alive in the Underhill until she's
able to get her out<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Anna goes to visit Sally's grave and then to a hospital, where she
finds out Sally was visited by a man wearing a coat with silver hunting
dogs on it before she died. She gets angry at this point, saying that
he-- that is, <a href="the_King" class="wikilink" title="the King">the
King</a> of the Underhill-- couldn't even let Sally die in peace<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. She opens one of Luna's letters--
all of which say YOU PROMISED-- and realizes that Sally abandoned Luna
to the underhill.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>As Anna tries to figure out what to do, the visitor from episode
three comes back to the house to speak to Anna. It's revealed that his
name is <a href="Thomas" class="wikilink" title="Thomas">Thomas</a>,
he's Mabel's father, and he has been lost for a very long time-- stuck
in a loop of the last day he was truly alive. He tells Anna "Hay una
puerta; necesitas descubrirlo" which translates roughly to "There is a
door; you need to find it [or find out]." When Anna tells Mabel this,
she stops responding using the lights.<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>Anna finds out she's been left the entire Martin estate by Sally.
Afterwards, she finds a strange recipe book and creates a potion made
from a page that reads "to open doors." She drinks the potion-- made
entirely of poison-- and the episode ends with her falling to the floor,
presumably dead.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>The next time we hear from Anna, she is rambling about the story of
Orpheus. We learn that she had tried to get Mabel out of the Underworld
but had not turned around -- just as the story of Orpheus and Eurydice
had warned against -- and accidentally left Mabel behind. She goes
through a series of doors and solves several riddles, eventually finding
Mabel again. She swaps their places-- Mabel being sent to the Martin
house and Anna being left under the hill.<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="season_three">Season Three</h2>
<p>At some point within this season, part of Anna (her hair, presumably)
is torn out to create the changeling who would later remake herself as
<a href="Veratrine" class="wikilink"
title="Veratrine">Veratrine</a>.</p>
<p>When she finally does return<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>, she calls Mabel and
parrots the first phone call she ever sent to her. She speaks about
learning to be unkind as she rots under the hill and gets very, very
angry at Mabel, who she is sure cannot hear her, before talking about
how they're literally integral to each other. The author is breaking the
formal tone of this wiki to say: Anna, that is <em>super gay</em>.</p>
<p>Mabel makes a deal with the House and brings Anna back to the 'real
world,' where they finally get to kiss after Anna pushes Mabel against a
wall. After they talk and argue for some time, and while attempting to
run from the King, Anna orders the House to keep them both safe and let
them go. This makes the two of them realize Anna has control over the
laws of matter in the Martin home, and can also control Mabel herself.
At some point during this time, Anna's hand is set on fire, leaving her
with a skeleton-style hand, commonly called her "fist of bone."</p>
<p>Mabel and Anna make the mutual decision to take down the King,
planning to kill him and take his place.<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="season_four">Season Four</h2>
<p>Anna's story is broadcast across news stations throughout the
country, including several conspiracy theory podcasts (such as the Daily
Bite &amp; Spook City). Back in the Underhill, Anna and Mabel are
approached by Anna's double, now calling herself <a href="Veratrine"
class="wikilink" title="Veratrine">Veratrine</a>. Veratrine tries to
turn Anna against Mabel by telling her that Mabel had killed her, but
Anna explains that she already knew that.</p>
<p>The three girls head into the ball the Court is holding; Anna
attempts to challenge the King, but fails due to getting dtracted by
seeing her long-dead uncle Jack.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>They escape to the House, where Mabel and Veratrine both get eaten;
after pulling them out, they decide to head to Mabel's room, as it is
the safest area in the House for the three of them. Mabel gets eaten by
the House again. They save her again.</p>
<p>The girls go on a treasure hunt which leads them to Lily's room.
Lily's room is completely wrecked, and they find a datura seed pod
within it, which causes them to believe the cycle of what had occurred
throughout season one is beginning again. Vera makes fun of Mabel and
Anna asks her to provide a single reason why she shouldn't just kill
her; Vera asks if Anna wants Mabel to know what a murderer she is.<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>Mabel finds writings from when she was a child and realizes the
reason them challenging the King didn't work last time was because there
was no ritual involved; they have to challenge him. Anna and Mabel
promise the House that they will return and then go back to the
Underhill. After Anna and Mabel have a fight, Mabel compares Anna to
Sally, and Anna, in an attempt to apologize, explains to Mabel the real
reason she came to the Martin house.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>When Anna was in college, she had visions of another girl, all the
time. She thought she was going insane, and she cut the connection to
the other girl-- who was, of course, Mabel. The cutting of the cord, so
to speak, left Anna feeling numb to the world until she arrived at the
House. Mabel has Anna promise to never do that again, and Anna explains
that all she wants is to be with Mabel. Mabel says that, because there
aren't any secrets between them, she wants to stay in the Underhill
rather than going back to the human world. They both apologize to each
other and hug (or possibly kiss?) before Mabel says they're going to go
gut a tyrant.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>They go to challenge the King and Anna gets possessed by him.<a
href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> When she's let go, Mabel gets her
to a safe place and they talk about it. Vera comes back in perhaps the
greatest line in the entire show, and Anna and Mabel attempt to comfort
her before going off to challenge the King for the final time. Anna
names Mabel as her champion. <img src="VERA_I_LOVE_YOU.png"
title="episode 32, temporal snake." width="384" height="384"
alt="episode 32, temporal snake." /></p>
<p>Anna wins after some <a href="Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake"
class="wikilink" title="Absolutely Buckwild Challenging">Absolutely
Buckwild Challenging</a> and frees Mabel of her bonds. They tell each
other they love each other before a boy named Brandon walks into the
room of the House they are in and shoots Mabel, and then himself.<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a><br />
== Season Six == Anna first appears attempting to get Mabel to let her
look at her bullet wound. Mabel, in the midst of what seems like a panic
attack, does not let her, but Anna eventually manages to dig it out,
telling Mabel secrets in order to presumably keep her distracted. Mabel
eventually faints and Anna holds her while trying to wake her up. Anna
wraps Mabel's wound in her shirt and sphagnum moss and the bullet burns
her when she attempts to pick it up. The House brings her a box of SD
cards, which are from Aurora Silver's collection.<a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>Mabel wakes up and chugs some silver water, and they have a small
discussion before falling asleep.</p>
<p>The House puts them in the attic, which is filled with locusts. Mabel
tells Anna she was poisoned by the bullet and then refuses to say
anything else on the matter, causing Anna to become frustrated and
attempt to leave the room. After a minute, the girls have an actual
discussion about their emotions. Mabel tells Anna Sally put her in the
attic as a child, and she ate the locusts to avoid starving. Anna tells
Mabel she wants to know everything about her, even the most boring
parts, and Mabel takes that to mean Anna believes the abuse she went
through as a child was boring. Anna retorts that she'd never said that,
and after a brief fight, the dead body of the boy with the gun arrives
in the attic, turning into a snake.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Anna drags Mabel to a safe place and solves several riddles to
realize Mabel's having an allergic reaction to the iron in the bullet.
She cuts out the bullet and Mabel wakes up before Mabel tells Anna they
have to go to her coronation to become the King of the Hill.</p>
<p><a href="Ekaterina_Roskova" class="wikilink"
title="Aconite">Aconite</a> challenges Anna for the throne, and Anna and
Mabel use the tapes they have to prove to her that she is not the King's
daughter, and was instead tortured until she believed she was to escape
from the abuse she was suffering.</p>
<p>After Anna is officially crowned, there is a time skip. <a
href="Janet_Kirk" class="wikilink" title="Janet Kirk">Janet Kirk</a>
finds her, half-starved, three years after she disappears under the
hill.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="season_seven">Season Seven</h2>
<p>Anna is pulled out of the House's walls by Janet Kirk; Janet's friend
<a href="Eidolon_García" class="wikilink" title="Eidolon García">Eidolon
García</a> arrives when Anna attempts to "bite a piece" out of Janet in
revenge. As they are no longer in the prime timeline, Anna struggles
with her displacement into this world, and looks for Mabel without
regard for anything or anyone. As she tells Mabel about what's happening
through voicemails similar to season one, she and the other two women
decide to perform a ritual in an attempt to summon Mabel. It fails, and
Anna remains stuck in the wrong timeline.<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="physical_description">Physical Description</h2>
<p>Anna is an indigenous Mexican woman. She is short (though, and this
is crucial, she is taller than Mabel<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>) and fat. She has
brown curly hair and brown eyes.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>The creators of the show have specifically stated that they do not
care how Anna and Mabel are portrayed, so long as neither of them are
portrayed as white.</p>
