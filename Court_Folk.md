This page is dedicated to the regular citizens of the underhill we have
gotten to hear about or from.

### Spindrift

Spindrift is, presumably, a citizen of Faery Hill, utilized as a vessel
by [Luna Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink} in [Episode 30:
The
Consort](Episode_Thirty:_The_Consort "Episode 30: The Consort"){.wikilink}.
Therefore, we know little to nothing of Spindrift herself. While in her
body, Luna invites [Mabel
Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink}, [Anna
Limón](Anna_Limón "Anna Limón"){.wikilink}, and
[Veratrine](Veratrine "Veratrine"){.wikilink} to an audience with [the
King](the_King "the King"){.wikilink}. She is sent away so she cannot
hear and interfere with their plans, but Veratrine runs after her.

### Thornblood and Chalcedony {#thornblood_and_chalcedony}

Thornblood and Chalcedony are heard gossiping about royal affairs in
[Pas de
Deux](Episode_Thirty-Seven:_Pas_De_Deux "Pas de Deux"){.wikilink},
during the ball before Anna's claim to the throne. While the former does
not seem to think their kings-to-be will be up for the task, the latter
has more hope in them. Chalcedony also remarks how fond of Mabel Martin
the old King used to be. Thornblood expects jealousy from Luna Thorne,
but Chalcedony thinks she is probably grateful for her newfound freedom
and believes it will be someone else who will be jealous.
