Tressa Davies is played by Tressa Evans-Salvemini. She is the
protagonist of Mabel: [Infinity
Mirror](Infinity_Mirror "Infinity Mirror"){.wikilink}, a five-episode
special season (referred to, for ease of access, as Season Five). Her
voice also appears briefly in [Aurora Silver is Willing to
Wait](Episode_Twenty-Nine:_Aurora_Silver_is_Willing_to_Wait "Aurora Silver is Willing to Wait"){.wikilink}.\

## Infinity Mirror {#infinity_mirror}

Tressa is a recent college drop-out from Ithaca, New York, formerly
studying medieval history. She enjoys embroidery and her cats; she also
has a condition called nemaline myopathy (this season, more than all
others, deals with the ramifications of abuse and mistreatment of
children, specifically disabled children). She wins the competition that
[Becca De La Rosa](Becca_De_La_Rosa "Becca De La Rosa"){.wikilink} and
[Maybell Marten](Maybell_Marten "Maybell Marten"){.wikilink} run, going
to stay in Becca\'s grandmother\'s old
[House](The_House "House"){.wikilink}. After eating their food and
telling them stories, Tressa finds she cannot leave the house; Becca and
Maybell then reveal that they\'ve been Anna and Mabel the entire time,
and they\'ve trapped her in their house until she repents for what
she\'s done.

She reveals that she went to a school called Lang Primary Conservatory
for the Disabled, and lived under the care of Lara Ouvriers, which is an
anagram of [Aurora Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}.
When she was very young, she watched Aurora and her cult sacrifice
another student, referred to as the mourning dove, in order to try to
summon a god, presumably [the King](the_King "the King"){.wikilink}.
After she admits this, she unstitches time itself and stops the event
from ever happening before thanking [Anna &
Mabel](Anna_&_Mabel "Anna & Mabel"){.wikilink} for what they\'ve helped
her do. The last we hear from her is her laughing with both creators as
the final episode fades out.
