<h2 id="episode_summary">Episode Summary</h2>
<p>This episode takes place in a universe different from the canonical
one, where <a href="Anna_LimÃ³n" class="wikilink" title="Anna">Anna</a>
is a journalist writing about urban legends and <a href="Mabel_Martin"
class="wikilink" title="Mabel">Mabel</a> works in a flower shop. They
meet after Anna knocks something over in Mabel's shop, and Anna calls
Mabel to talk to her about a story Mabel promised her. They meet up in a
coffee shop and Anna records the interview. Anna, after trying really,
really hard not to flirt, asks Mabel about the house she grew up in, and
Mabel talks a bit about archetypes in fairy tales. After briefly
discussing their ancestors-- and Anna telling Mabel she looks "like an
Aztec statue, a little bit," which is perhaps the wiki curator's
favorite Anna Loves Mabel line-- the tape recorder fritzes out.</p>
<p>The tape recorder cuts back in to the two of them discussing ghosts;
Mabel offers to show Anna the <a href="The_House" class="wikilink"
title="House">House</a>. Anna is delighted (she even wore her
trespassing boots!) and agrees to go, even though Mabel explains that
she's not allowed on the property because she's been cut out of the
family.</p>
<p>They talk for a while about all sorts of things, and then head off to
the House, breaking in. When they get into the House, Sally yells Anna's
name from upstairs, and Mabel freaks out, dragging Anna to the library.
Anna asks if she's being punked, and Mabel promises she's not. Mabel
apologizes for panicking when they get to the library, and Anna asks
what Sally had done to her. Mabel laughs, saying that most people assume
she'd been the one to do something. She asks Anna how she knows she was
the wronged party, and Anna asks Mabel how she knew that she had injured
her knee in an earlier conversation. They both agree each other is very
familiar to them.</p>
<p>Mabel shows Anna <a href="Lily_Martin" class="wikilink"
title="Lily">Lily</a>'s journal and Anna tells Mabel about <a
href="Jack_Madrigal" class="wikilink" title="Jack">Jack</a>, explaining
that she always has to know everything, even when it would be safer not
to. Anna reads the passage from Freeze that explains Lily's death, and
then the House steals the journal back, Anna suddenly dealing with
immense pain from strange singing inside of the house. Mabel tells her
about a dream she has when the House is a black hole; Anna tells Mabel
about a dream where she sees a woman (Luna Thorne) in a house of
mirrors. Anna asks Mabel what she sees in "the heart of the collapsing
star" and Mabel responds "This house. The kingdom beyond the firmament.
I saw you. I saw you. I saw you."</p>
