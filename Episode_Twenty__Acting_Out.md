## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Mabel declares that she is going to cold-blood murder the changeling
who\'s replaced Anna, before calling back Anna\'s friend in order to
tell her that Anna\'s been replaced by a changeling. The woman does not
listen to her.

While Mabel talks to Anna, the door is constantly knocked on by an
unknown person, who Mabel assumes to be the changeling. She decides to
go chase down the changeling after giving\-- for lack of a better
descriptor\--  the gayest monologue in the entire show (\"Anna, Saint
Anna. Our future is pure and shining\...\").

Her mind made up, she burns down the entire south wing of the house in
order to escape.
