**Episode description:** [Anna](Anna_Lim√≥n "Anna"){.wikilink} receives a
mysterious note, and a mysterious dream (or is it a prophecy?)

## Episode Overview {#episode_overview}

Anna has a dream and finds a note.

#### **Trigger Warnings** {#trigger_warnings}

- Body part replacement.

## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Anna finds a note with a segment from the Ballad of Tam Lin, with the
name \"Thomas\" replacing \"Tam Lin.\"

*"Had I known, Thomas," said she, "a maid would ransom thee, I'd have
taken out thy two grey eyes and put in two eyes of tree. Had I but
known, Thomas," she said, \"Thomas, if I had known, I'd have taken out
your beating heart and put in a heart of stone."*

She then tells Mabel about a dream she had where she was stuck in a
tunnel; the tunnel\'s floor was covered in small bones and had LISTEN
written on the wall. She found a three-way fork in the road, labelled
FAITHLESSNESS, FEAR, and \"THE CAGE IN THE HILL IS A CAGE OF BONE.\" She
cuts off before she tells Mabel what she chose.

## Trivia

`<small>`{=html}**Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.**`</small>`{=html}

- The exert from Tam Lin references
  [Thomas](Thomas "Thomas"){.wikilink}, of course, but Tam Lin\'s
  heroine is usually named Janet. Her name mirrors a certain
  [adventurer](Janet_Kirk "adventurer"){.wikilink} within the podcast.
- Tam Lin was also originally referred to as Tom a Lin, according to
  some sources, so that might be relevant in terms of his name, too.\
