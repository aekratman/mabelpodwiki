Green Pines was a school for troubled rich kids at sometime in the early
2000s. [Jonathan Mills](Jonathan_Mills "Jonathan Mills"){.wikilink}
attended the school in his teenage years and was bullied severely until
his bully was killed by Aurora Silver. It has since shut down, but when
Jonathan attended, it was a feeder school for cult recruitment. Little
else is known about the place.
