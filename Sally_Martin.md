*Last night I performed the ritual. I had gathered every bit of the
ingredients, even the piece -- the piece of my own skin, which was
thoroughly unpleasant, but I gritted my teeth and bore it. Never say I
am not a Martin.*\

Sally Martin was an antagonist in the first season of *Mabel*. Please be

## Season One {#season_one}

Sally Martin born around 1926[^1] and was close with [Luna
Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink} in her teenage years, but
she eventually left Luna as she did not want to follow her into the
Underhill. She married a man named [Esau](Esau "Esau"){.wikilink},
though she kept her family name.

She had one daughter, [Lily](Lily_Martin "Lily"){.wikilink} (who
resented her for most of her life[^2]). Sally took in her granddaughter
[Mabel Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink} when Lily went
missing and was eventually found dead. Sally was severely abusive to
Mabel and eventually sent her away to [El Segundo
Academy](El_Segundo_Academy "El Segundo Academy"){.wikilink} after
pulling her out of public school.

As Sally aged, she eventually needed a live-in carer; [Anna
Limón](Anna_Limón "Anna Limón"){.wikilink} took the job. Anna and Sally
originally got on very well (with Anna referring to herself later as a
\"replacement daughter\" who Sally had to pay out of pocket), but Anna
eventually got involved in the secrets of Fairy Hill and went into the
Underhill, not returning until after Sally died due to exposure, where
she was found wrapped in rose thorns. Sally told Anna she had tried to
save Luna Thorne; she died in the hospital while [the
King](the_King "the King"){.wikilink} visited her and left the entire
Martin estate to Anna.

## Season Seven {#season_seven}

In [The Past is a Dream of
Itself](Episode_Forty-Two:_The_Past_is_a_Dream_of_Itself "The Past is a Dream of Itself"){.wikilink},
Anna reads Sally\'s journal. Inside, Sally writes that she completed a
dangerous ritual (\"On the Basis of Exchange\"), stole Luna Thorne\'s
power, and rebirthed her brother
[Phillip](Phillip_Martin "Phillip"){.wikilink} in the form of her
daughter [Lily Martin](Lily_Martin "Lily Martin"){.wikilink}.

[^1]: [Episode Twelve:
    Asterion](Episode_Twelve:_Asterion "Episode Twelve: Asterion"){.wikilink}
    states that Sally was 22 in 1948.
