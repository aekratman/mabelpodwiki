Lily Martin was an antagonist in <em>Mabel.</em> She has no known voice
actress. Please be warned that this page contains discussion of
abuse.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="seasons_one_six">Seasons One-Six</h2>
<p>Lily Martin was the daughter of <a href="Sally_Martin"
class="wikilink" title="Sally Martin">Sally Martin</a> and <a
href="Esau" class="wikilink" title="Esau">Esau</a>. In her teenage
years, she was in love with a faerie named <a href="Juniper"
class="wikilink" title="Juniper">Juniper</a>, who she met in a field;
Juniper fell in love with her when she laughed. However, they did not
end up staying together, their relationship ending with Juniper
predicting her death. Later on, she had a brief fling with a man named
<a href="Thomas_Ortega" class="wikilink" title="Thomas">Thomas</a> that
resulted in <a href="Mabel_Martin" class="wikilink"
title="Mabel Martin">Mabel Martin</a> being born. She was abusive to
Mabel. At some point she saw Mabel as she truly was (complicated--
possibly a changeling, possibly she just saw <a href="Luna_Thorne"
class="wikilink" title="Luna Thorne">Luna Thorne</a>)<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
She died with broken bones in her throat<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
when Mabel was four. Mabel has her last name rather than Thomas's.</p>
<p>It is canon that Lily wore lilies in her hair as a teenager,
according to <em>Letter from Juniper</em>. It is also canon that she was
a <a
href="https://mabelpodcast.tumblr.com/post/650194294016294912/hello-hello-i-have-been-trying-with-little-luck">dabbler
in alchemy.</a></p>
<p>Lily kept a journal detailing much of her life as a teenager. The
journal is described as a "leather-bound spiral notebook" by <a
href="Anna_Limón" class="wikilink" title="Anna">Anna</a> in Episode 8:
The Freeze when she finds the journal on the kitchen counter. It is
stuffed with clippings from old magazines, including one from a Virginia
Slims ad that says, "You've come a long way, baby." Instead of a name on
the back of the front cover, Anna finds a picture of roses from Sally's
garden. In the journal, Lily describes a dream she had from the
perspective of a bird. When explaining why she hesitated to run away
with Juniper, one of her reasons for staying was that her friend, Jo,
would be waiting for her at the bus stop. The journal also includes in
its pages a drawing of the alchemical symbol for mercury. This symbol
was tied back to the Hand of Mysteries by Mabel Martin and Becca De La
Rosa during a live event where Mabel Martin mentioned that the Hand of
Mysteries might be a good avenue of research as it contained "pictorial
references."</p>
<h2 id="season_seven">Season Seven</h2>
<p>Sally Martin completed a ritual called "On The Basis of Exchange"
before Lily was born in order to clone her older brother, <a
href="Phillip_Martin" class="wikilink" title="Phillip Martin">Phillip
Martin</a>, and rebirth him. This clone ended up being Lily herself.</p>
<p>Lily is heard talking to Mabel during an unknown time period in <a
href="Episode_Forty-Four:_Ashes,_Ashes" class="wikilink"
title="Ashes, Ashes">Ashes, Ashes</a>. It sounds like she is saying "it
is my house-- it was always my house, you need to leave."<br />
