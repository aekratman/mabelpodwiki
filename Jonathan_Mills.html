Jonathan is portrayed by <a href="Becca_De_La_Rosa" class="wikilink"
title="Becca De La Rosa">Becca De La Rosa</a> in season four and <a
href="C.S.W." class="wikilink" title="C.S.W">C.S.W</a> in season seven.
This page contains discussion of death, bullying, abuse, homophobia, and
suicide.</p>
<h2 id="season_four">Season Four</h2>
<p>Jonathan is a member of <a href="Aurora_Silver" class="wikilink"
title="Aurora Silver">Aurora Silver</a>'s cult and has been since he was
a teenager. He records <a href="The_King" class="wikilink"
title="The King">The King</a>'s voice and then loses it, which makes
Aurora Silver incredibly angry. In retribution, she sends <a
href="Brandon" class="wikilink" title="Brandon">Brandon</a>, Jonathan's
apprentice (?), off to his death in the <a href="The_House"
class="wikilink" title="Martin House.">Martin House.</a></p>
<p>Jonathan grew up rich and spoiled. When he was sent to <a
href="Green_Pines" class="wikilink" title="Green Pines">Green Pines</a>,
the academy for troubled boys he attended as a teenager, he dealt with
severe abuse by his classmates, which was implied to be homophobic in
nature. Aurora Silver saved him from being killed by his bullies, and
he's been completely loyal to her ever since-- <em>specifically</em>
her, not to the cult nor to the supernatural beliefs they follow.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><br />
==Season Seven== Jonathan is mentioned in <a
href="Episode_Forty-One:_A_Superfluity" class="wikilink"
title="A Superfluity">A Superfluity</a>; Aurora Silver says he's been
recording more messages from the King. Seeing as we don't know when this
takes place in the timeline, it could be from before his last
appearance.</p>
<p>Next time we hear from him, he has decided to rebel against Aurora
Silver because he feels Brandon's death was unfair and petty. He records
a contingency plan in case he is killed and says that he has no religion
or loyalty towards Aurora, who he feels is like a political extremist.
He realized due to Brandon's death that none of the cultists matter to
her, so he's decided to wait until he is either killed or finds a way to
make the deaths of his peers mean something.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Our last time hearing from Jonathan is his final monlogue. He's
speaking to Mabel, saying he had read her file (from when she was [ a
subject](The_Subjects ” a subject”){.wikilink}) when he was still in
school. He says that even if he could have, he would not have saved her,
because he was more concerned with following orders. Nonetheless, he's
has read the files of many subjects in an attempt to humanize them.</p>
<p>He says that Aurora Silver thought Mabel was special, and that he
knows <em>he</em> isn't-- he's a foot soldier and isn't ashamed of it.
He says he would have died if he has been special like Mabel was, and
knows that as a soldier, he has been put to "ill use." We hear him
cutting his own skin, repeating that what he's saying isn't a
confession. He apologizes to Mabel and begins to break down about what
happened to both her and to Brandon; he says "This isn't a confession.
This is an obituary. <i> Get out.</i>" before noises of burning and a
stag roaring overwhelm the soundscape. This implies his suicide.<a

<ul>
<li>According to the creators, it's far too late to save Jonathan from
the cult.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>C.S.W. put up character notes on Jonathan's arc <a

after playing him in Ashes, Ashes.</li>
<li>In some versions of the story, according to Maybell Marten, Jonathan
and Mabel could have been friends.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
