<p>El Segundo Academy was a "cult school" ran by <a href="Aurora_Silver"
class="wikilink" title="Aurora Silver">Aurora Silver</a>. It is the
focus of the extra content site <a
href="https://whathappenedatelsegundo.com/">What Happened At El
Segundo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>El Segundo was a "pseudo-therapeutic, borderline militaristic
boarding school" in California. It was founded by Gertrude Edgeworth and
experienced several scandals surrounding the discipline used within the
school. This discipline apparently included solitary confinement, hard
manual labor, and getting their heads shaved.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="section">2001-2003</h2>
<p>Between 2001 and 2002, the number of students at ESA went from 97 to
46. All the girls were moved into two 20-person dorms, and the
overcrowding led to more fighting among the student body. A girl named
Elizabeth Hook, a former ESA student, was discovered in the Tahoe
National Forest by a sophomore from ESA. Her boyfriend, a cocaine dealer
named Louis Van Straaten, was charged with her murder.</p>
<p>In September, the music department was flooded unexpectedly, seeing
as there was no body of water that could have done the flooding. In
October, 27 students were trapped in Meredith dormitory by over 30 wild
foxes. Police were called, but the foxes dispesed when an unknown
student walked through the circle unharmed.</p>
<p>On November 1st, the ESA chefs found every egg they had to be full of
stones. The next day (<a href="Mabel_Martin" class="wikilink"
title="Mabel Martin">Mabel Martin</a>'s birthday), part of the school
building collapsed. Students began to faint in the morning assembly
consistently.</p>
<p>On December 19th, the school's director, <a href="Ron_Newman"
class="wikilink" title="Ron Newman">Ron Newman</a>, disappeared. Six
rattlesnakes were found in his office. He was found on December 24,
incoherent and shirtless, covered in black mud. He never recovered from
his ordeal.</p>
<p>The three students who had stayed behind during winter break were
snowed in by a blizzard on December 25. They were completely alone save
for Maribeth Parker. One of the girls who stayed ended up disappearing
from "secluded cabin somewhere in the San Bernardino mountains" not long
after ESA burned down.</p>
<p>Only 38 students returned to ESA after winter break, and they were
all stuck into one dorm (Meredith). They shared four to a room. Fighting
and punishments increased; by the time the class returned from spring
break in late March, only 26 girls were enrolled in El Segundo.</p>
<h2 id="april_3rd_2003">April 3rd 2003</h2>
<p>On April 3rd 2003 (exactly thirteen years after the disappearance of
Lily Martin, as said in <a href="Episode_Twelve:_Asterion"
class="wikilink" title="Asterion">Asterion</a>), El Segundo's main
building burned down. Meredith dorm was flooded. <a href="Callie"
class="wikilink" title="Callie">Callie</a> called the Jericho fire
department and two cops were sent to investigate the call, at which
point a window exploded with black smoke. Over half the students were
injured; Maribeth Parker disappeared for good.<br />
