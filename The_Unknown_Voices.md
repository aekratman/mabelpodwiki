The Unknown Voices are three members of [Aurora
Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}\'s cult who record the
Court\'s activity. Two of them\--
[Jonathan](Jonathan_Mills "Jonathan"){.wikilink} and
[Brandon](Brandon "Brandon"){.wikilink}\-- are named. They record the
King\'s voice during season four before losing the actual recording,
which upsets Aurora so much that she sends Brandon off to his ultimate
fate of death in the Hill. Each of their appearances can be found in
[this
