Janet Kirk is played by [Dorrie
Sacks](Dorrie_Sacks "Dorrie Sacks"){.wikilink}. She is a secondary
protagonist in seasons six and seven of *Mabel*.

## Season Six {#season_six}

Janet first appears trying to break into the Martin
[House](The_House "House"){.wikilink} on Friday the Thirteenth. She
explains the backstory of the \"urban legend\" of [Anna
Limón](Anna_Limón "Anna Limón"){.wikilink} before the House attempts to
eat her by drowing her in a pile of leaves.[^1] After escaping the
leaves, she ends up within the house, where she finds a series of
graffiti on the walls, including one that says *Janet Kirk met her own
death*.[^2]

She decides the content she wanted to get isn\'t worth it, and moves to
leave. While doing so, she finds Anna starving and half-dead\-- she
calls 911 for medical aid and then tells Anna that she\'d been missing
for the past three years.[^3]

## Season Seven {#season_seven}

Janet is first heard from in season seven in her voicemail, which
[Eidolon García](Eidolon_García "Eidolon García"){.wikilink} (Lolo) is
calling. Lolo pulls into the destination her GPS tells her to and finds
Janet chasing after Anna, trying to get her to stick around for an
ambulance. Lolo insists that they have to leave and she and Janet fight,
Lolo saying she had told Janet not to go to the Martin House alone. Anna
uses her powers on Janet after asking why she cut her out of the wall.

Janet was apparently brought into the mystery by Lolo, and directly went
against her wishes by going to the Martin Place by herself. Due to this
betrayal, Lolo refers to her as a tourist in the strange and
unusual.[^4] She knows some of the secrets of the Martin House
(including what happened in the twenties and Mabel\'s death in this
timeline) due to her friendship with Lolo.

Janet helps Lolo and Anna attempt a ritual in the Martin home; she dies
trying to pull Mabel from the House\'s walls all of an hour after asking
Lolo out on a date. The wiki\'s curator is super normal about this.
