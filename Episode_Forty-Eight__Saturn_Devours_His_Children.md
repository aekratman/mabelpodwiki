## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Having arrived at the Martin House, [
Lolo](Eidolon_García " Lolo"){.wikilink}, [
Janet](Janet_Kirk " Janet"){.wikilink}, and [
Anna](Anna_Limón " Anna"){.wikilink} prepare for the summoning ritual to
get Mabel back. Janet draws chalk outlines on the floor with Lolo\'s
guidance, and they discuss various topics. Lolo reveals that she was
lying to Anna in \[an episode check which one\]; the world wouldn\'t end
if they took Mabel back, but it scared Lolo that Anna doesn't care about
the consequences of her actions so long as Mabel is safe. Janet asks
Lolo out on a date, and Lolo accepts.

Anna comes in with a collection of papers that Lolo had found when
studying Mabel\'s case. She becomes angry that people strip Mabel's
life-- and the abuse she faced-- into a story. They discuss how the
ritual will work and then begin after Janet apologizes to Anna for
treating Anna and Mabel like a story. Lolo, Janet, and Anna (in that
order) take turns reciting speeches. As the House shakes around them,
the girls realize something is very, very wrong. Janet dies trying to
get Mabel, and when Anna finally pulls Mabel out, she only begins to
recite the first line [Mabel?](Mabel? "Mabel?"){.wikilink} ever said, as
\"only a voice\" and not a full person.

The episode ends there.

  [Delirium](Episode_Thirty-Five:_Delirium "Delirium"){.wikilink}

  --\".)

## Trivia

`<small>`{=html}**Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.**`</small>`{=html}

- Lolo and Janet\'s universe is apparently concentrated near LA: Janet
  asks Lolo out to Canter\'s, a deli in the area.
- The episode\'s title is likely a reference to the painting [Saturn
  Devouring His
  Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Devouring_His_Son) (tw:
  gore).
