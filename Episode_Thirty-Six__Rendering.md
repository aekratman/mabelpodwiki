## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

[Mabel](Mabel_Martin "Mabel"){.wikilink} explains how the coronation
will run, promising to stay with [Anna](Anna_Limón "Anna"){.wikilink}.
We hear briefly from a subject called 5712, who repeats the line \"It's
really you. I missed you so much\" over and over. The girls discuss the
King\'s status as a tyrant, and then
[Aconite](Aconite "Aconite"){.wikilink} takes over the narrative,
speaking of how she arrived in the hill and found her father. We hear a
tape of Mabel when she was a subject when her voicemail repeats over and
over. Then we hear from the girls in a different life\-- where Mabel is
a florist and Anna is a customer, flirting with each other. 

Back to Aconite, we hear various histories of her death\-- the Black
Death and dying while immigrating to the States among them\-- before she
promises to take her father\'s throne back from Anna despite clearly
having no idea how she died or who she is. Lastly we see
[Janet](Janet_Kirk "Janet"){.wikilink}, still in the House, deciding to
run after telling her audience to always tell people where you\'re going
when on a ghost hunt. She starts screaming to be let out, which the
House echos back to her dreamily in Anna\'s voice.

## Continuity

- Janet had previously mentioned not telling anyone where she was. This
  leaves her abandoned in the Martin Place.
- The House having Anna\'s voice is a new development.
- Aconite\'s true death fits none of these narratives.
