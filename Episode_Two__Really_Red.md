## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Anna calls Mabel several times throughout a day at her job, telling her
she is now sure Mabel is listening because the voicemail box has been
emptied. Anna talks about her issues with depersonalization due to being
removed from society in the hills. She also talks about how she
occasionally gets very, very angry about very small things. Today, she
had found a dead baby crow outside the door, and proceeded to get very
upset about the state of things; largely, almost focally, about the fact
that Mabel isn\'t there, in the house. She tells Mabel about Sally\'s
current issues, then tells Mabel about the dream she had, where she met
a girl with a very red mouth who mouthed something at her, three
syllables long. She then calls Mabel later that night and goes to try to
open a letter. Just as she\'s about to, Sally screams and falls in the
floor above Anna, and Anna hangs up to go get her.\
