The House is a character in its own right, and serves as a primary
antagonist and supporting character for the entirety of *Mabel.*

## All Seasons {#all_seasons}

The Martin House on the hill in King\'s County is an enigma; it served
as protector and jailer of [Mabel
Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink} for Mabel\'s entire
life, keeping her safe from the abuse of her family and her own
self-injury but nonetheless trapping her in its attempts to keep her
safe. It is not benevolent, but it has saved both [Girls with Subzero
Chill](Anna_&_Mabel "Girls with Subzero Chill"){.wikilink} from death
(or, you know, re-death) on numerous occasions.

It can apparently move between worlds, and serves as a form of gateway
or liminal space between our reality and the Underhill, as made clear in
[ From the
Walls](Infinity_Mirror_Part_Two:_From_the_Walls " From the Walls"){.wikilink}.
The Martins have apparently always owned the House, or at least they did
before [Sally Martin](Sally_Martin "Sally Martin"){.wikilink} left it to
[Anna Limón](Anna_Limón "Anna Limón"){.wikilink} rather than her
grandchild. Anna is intrinsically tied to the House\-- she refers to it
as \"the skin \[she\] wear\[s\] over her own skin.\"

It has eaten [Veratrine](Veratrine "Veratrine"){.wikilink} while she was
still living, along with [Brandon](Brandon "Brandon"){.wikilink}\'s dead
body and pieces of [Thomas](Thomas "Thomas"){.wikilink}. It has
*attempted* to eat both the Girls on several occasions, though it\'s
never managed to keep them.

## Canonical Rooms {#canonical_rooms}

The House has several rooms which appear in its basic form. These
includes the Green Parlor, the Blue Room, Sally\'s room, Lily\'s room,
Mabel\'s fake room, Mabel\'s attic space, and the kitchen. People can
move throughout the House\'s walls after death (as Anna and Mabel both
do); the House can also eat both souls and bodies.

## Important Events Within {#important_events_within}

Some important events the House has been involved in are as follows:

- The discovery of [The First
  Riddle](The_First_Riddle "The First Riddle"){.wikilink} in the Blue
  Room.[^1]
- The attempted consumption of Mabel Martin on several occasions (most
  notably during her time on the run from the King with Anna and
  Veratrine)[^2]
- The eating or attempting eating of Veratrine, Thomas, Brandon, Tressa
  Davies, etc.
- The keeping of Mabel Martin away from harm through her entire
  childhood, stifling her as a result
- The burning of the House\'s South Wing by Mabel Martin
- The axing of the House\'s walls by Anna Limón[^3]
- The looping of rooms to contain Tressa Davies[^4]
- The growth of a fruit tree to feed Mabel Martin[^5]
