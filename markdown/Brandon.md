## Season Four {#season_four}

Brandon is a member of [Aurora
Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}\'s cult. Throughout
season four, he (along with
[Jonathan](Jonathan_Mills "Jonathan"){.wikilink} and another Unknown
Voices) spies on the Underhill through recording devices. After Jonathan
loses a recording of [The King](The_King "The King"){.wikilink}\'s
voice, Aurora Silver takes Brandon away for a task that is later
revealed to be going to the Martin [House](The_House "House"){.wikilink}
and killing himself there. He shoots himself in the head after telling
Mabel he\'s going into the ground for her. The bullet goes through his
skull and then ricochets off of him, hitting Mabel in the arm. His body
is eaten by the House and is later dropped in front of Anna and Mabel
before being turned into a rattlesnake.[^1]

## Season Seven {#season_seven}

His death is Jonathan\'s motivator to betray the cult in [Ashes,
Ashes](Episode_Forty-Four:_Ashes,_Ashes "Ashes, Ashes"){.wikilink}.[^2]

[Eidolon García](Eidolon_García "Eidolon García"){.wikilink} explains
that she tried to save a spirit that was presumably Brandon when she was
twelve. He was upset to be taken out of the loop of his death, as he
felt his death was the most meaningful thing he\'d ever done.

## Trivia

- He\'s consistently referred to as \"young man\" or \"kid\" by the
  other characters, suggesting he\'s somewhere around 16-20 (confirmed
  in a post by Becca De La Rosa). If he was in fact the spirit Eidolon
  tried to save at a young age, he was only 17.
- He was very loyal to Aurora Silver\'s ideology, and wanted to be
  remembered for his work as a cultist.[^3]
