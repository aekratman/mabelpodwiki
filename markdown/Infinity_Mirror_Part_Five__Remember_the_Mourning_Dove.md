## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

[Tressa](Tressa_Davies "Tressa"){.wikilink} hears from her future self,
who warns her about [Becca De La
Rosa](Becca_De_La_Rosa "Becca De La Rosa"){.wikilink} and reminds her to
be clever. She allows herself to go a bit insane and gets into a fight
with the House. While trying to figure out where [Luna
Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink} and
[Veratrine](Veratrine "Veratrine"){.wikilink} went, the dollhouse Tressa
is messing with starts bleeding, and after having to listen to herself
again, she realizes she has to repent for the sins she\'s committed.

She screams that she wants to take back what she did. Then she admits
that the mourning dove was actually a boy her age, and that [Miss
Ouvriers](Aurora_Silver "Miss Ouvriers"){.wikilink} killed him. She
admits her complicity in it, and unstitches time in order to go back and
help her younger self be braver, implying that she is, in fact, the bird
that tried to poison her as a child.

She thanks Becca and Mabel for their help and answers the final question
on the paper\--"Number thirteen: does the snake eat its own tail?"
\"Yes. Yes, she does.\"\--before the episode ends with Tressa, Becca,
and Mabel laughing together.

## Continuity

**`<small>`{=html}Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.`</small>`{=html}**

- Tressa breaking down time explains how she could have appeared in
  [Aurora Silver is Willing to
  Wait](Episode_Twenty-Nine:_Aurora_Silver_is_Willing_to_Wait "Aurora Silver is Willing to Wait"){.wikilink}.
- She also \"unstitches\" time\--she was a seamstress before she came to
  the House.
- Becca\'s and Mabel\'s laughter can be heard at the beginning of each
  episode as well as the last.
- Snakes eating their own tails began as a motif as early as [episode
  seven](Episode_Seven:_King_in_the_Labyrinth "episode seven"){.wikilink}.

## Trivia

`<small>`{=html}**Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.**`</small>`{=html}

- Thanking Anna and Mabel is dangerous as that puts Tressa in their
  debt\-- hopefully they\'ll cash that favor sometime in season seven.
