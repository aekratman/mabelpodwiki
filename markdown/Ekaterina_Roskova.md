Ekaterina Roskova is played by [Alexandra
Serova](Alexandra_Serova "Alexandra Serova"){.wikilink}. She is a
secondary \'antagonist\' in season six of *Mabel*.

## Season Six {#season_six}

Ekaterina appears first in
[Primogeniture](Episode_Thirty-Three:_Primogeniture "Primogeniture"){.wikilink}
under the name Aconite. She speaks about how no member of the Underhill
is happy to see Anna or Mabel. As the season goes on, it is revealed
that she believes herself wholeheartedly to be the daughter of [the
King](the_King "the King"){.wikilink}; however, she is mistaken due to
suffering from amnesia.

She was born in Russia to a political dissident father who died when she
was a teenager. After her father\'s death, she was sent to the United
States, specifically the boarding school [St.
Olga\'s](Saint_Olga's_Preparatory "St. Olga's"){.wikilink}. After years
at the school, when she was 17, she was turned into an experiment by
[Aurora Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}. Referred to
as Subject 6163 during the experiments, she was tortured at length,
specifically with both knives and poison. After an unknown amount of
time, she succeeded in contacting some form of god while the cult
tortured her. After making contact with the \"fractured\" being, she
dies and ends up in the Underhill, not remembering anything about her
life. The King is the first being she sees, and she assumes him to be
her father.

She becomes a member of the Court. When Anna takes the King\'s throne,
she decides to challenge Anna for what she perceives as her
birthright.[^1] She nearly succeeds, but concedes the throne after Anna
and Mabel play her tapes from when she was stuck as 6163. Anna and Mabel
explain her true past, and she calls Anna \"your majesty\", showing a
newfound loyalty to the girls.[^2]

## Trivia

- Ekaterina was born in 1975. She became a subject in 1992, the year
  [Eidolon García](Eidolon_García "Eidolon García"){.wikilink} was born.
- Seeing as she grew up partially in Massachusetts, Ekaterina is the
  only member of the show to be from the east coast.
- \"Ekaterina\" means \"pure.\" With Aurora Silver\'s obsession on the
  process of purification, I hate that I know this fact!
- Her favorite foods are bog butter, bread, and honey.[^3]
- According to Becca De La Rosa: at this point, Ekaterina is no longer
  entirely herself; she does no longer possess a \"factual existence,\"
  and she now has to curate herself. \"She is, herself, a choice\" okay
  bdlr you want me to die???[^4]
