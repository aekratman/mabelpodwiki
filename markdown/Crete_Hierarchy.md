The Crete Hierarchy is the overarching motif in which each character
from *Mabel* corresponds to a character from the story of Theseus and
the Minotaur (or perhaps, more accurately, Ariadne and Her Shitty
Boyfriend and The Minotaur).

## Canonical Tie-ins {#canonical_tie_ins}

[Mabel Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink} as The Labyrinth
and The Minotaur.

[Anna Limón](Anna_Limón "Anna Limón"){.wikilink} as the Ball of Thread.

[Aurora Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink} as King Minos.

## Theoretical Tie-ins {#theoretical_tie_ins}

[Sally Martin](Sally_Martin "Sally Martin"){.wikilink} as Daedalus.

[Lily Martin](Lily_Martin "Lily Martin"){.wikilink} as Icarus.

[Brandon](Brandon "Brandon"){.wikilink} as Theseus.

[Ekaterina Roskova](Ekaterina_Roskova "Ekaterina Roskova"){.wikilink} as
Ariadne.

## Theoretical Reasoning {#theoretical_reasoning}

These theories were written by
[Abbey](https://ekaterinaroskova.tumblr.com), and any questions should
be directed to them.

Sally: Created the labyrinth (Mabel), punished the Minotaur (Mabel),
left Ariadne to use the thread (Anna) to wander through the maze.

Lily: Tried escaping the labyrinth (Mabel), and through her hubris died
for it.

Brandon: Almost kills the Minotaur (Mabel), young and stupid and sent to
die.

Ekaterina: Mabel\'s \"sister\" (both students of Aurora Silver / Minos)
who gave the thread (Anna) to the cult (when she summoned God!Anna in
episode 40).
