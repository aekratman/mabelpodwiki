## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

We hear a repeat of Brandon\'s death from [ Temporal
Snake](Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake " Temporal Snake"){.wikilink}
before cutting to meet [Janet Kirk](Janet_Kirk "Janet Kirk"){.wikilink},
a podcaster who is breaking into the Martin House on Friday the 13th.
She tells her listeners the \'urban legend\' of Anna\'s death and
describes [the House](the_House "the House"){.wikilink} before falling
in a pile of leaves and being deeply confused on how the leaves moved
like that.

A burst of distortion brings us to a very unhappy Mabel Martin,
screaming in pain, as Anna tries to figure out what happened. Mabel
screams at her not to touch her and it cuts away again.

We then meet [Aconite](Aconite "Aconite"){.wikilink}, who speaks about
the Court being unhappy with Anna\'s ascent to the throne.

While Anna attempts to yank the bullet out of Mabel\'s arm, the two of
them fight and then talk, before Mabel passes out .Anna drags Mabel to a
safer place and we hear a recording from [Subject
4583](The_Subjects "Subject 4583"){.wikilink}, who seems to literally
explode as he\'s experimented on. Anna then tells a still-unconscious
Mabel that the House gave her a tape deck full of SD cards, which only
played loud noise. Anna explains to Mabel that she is all that matters
to her, and Mabel wakes up. Shedrinks some collodial silver, and the two
of them lie down for a rare moment of domesticity.

Cutting back to Aconite, she explains that she has a place on the throne
over Anna, because Aconite is the first and only child of the King Under
the Hill. This means she has absolute primogeniture for the kingdom over
anyone else\-- the throne belongs to her.\
The episode ends.

## Continuity

- The repeat of the gunshot wound from Temporal Snake allows the
  listener to remember season four, seeing as [Infinity
  Mirror](Infinity_Mirror "Infinity Mirror"){.wikilink} took place in
  between episodes 32 & 33.
- Mabel chugging silver shows a contrast of her eventually-revealed
  allergy to iron.
- This is Anna\'s first \"I Am So In Love With Mabel Martin It Might
  Actually Kill Me\" since episode 32. How did she ever survive without
  being to ramble about how much she loves her wife?
