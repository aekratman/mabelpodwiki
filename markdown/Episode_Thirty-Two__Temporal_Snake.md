## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Anna chokes as the King stops possessing her body, the two girls
reuniting.

Aurora Silver berates [Jonathan](Jonathan_Mills "Jonathan"){.wikilink}
for losing the King\'s voice, and tells
[Brandon](Brandon "Brandon"){.wikilink}, the youngest cultist, to come
with her to complete a task she has for him.

Veratrine comes back to Anna and Mabel and the three of them discuss the
meeting with the King that they\'re headed to. Vera explains that Luna
created her rather than the King. Vera starts crying and the girls do
their best to comfort her. Then they head off to challenge the King.

Anna and Mabel explain how they defeated the King by telling it as a
(really beautiful and incredible) faery tale\-- Anna nominates Mabel as
her champion, and the King throws down an acorn, which he tells Mabel to
defeat. We later find out that when he gives her the acorn, Mabel is
sent into another world (?) where she can see the King\'s entire being
laid out in front of her before he allows her to win. Anna and Mabel win
the fight before Anna tells her younger self to be big and undiminished
and brave in one of the most well-loved monologues in the entire series,
while Luna and Veratrine decide to run away together. Anna frees Mabel
from her need to listen to anything Anna says and they say that they
love each other.

As Anna and Mabel are traveling back to the House, they run into
Brandon. He tells Mabel he\'s going into the ground for her before he
shoots himself in the head.
