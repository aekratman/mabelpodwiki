## All Appearances {#all_appearances}

The only mention of Laney Ketteredge is a question on Eidolon Garc√≠a\'s
contact page: *What happened to Laney Ketteredge in the Lockmore Hotel?*

## Speculation

Laney is a British name which means \"path\" or \"roadway\" (according
to Google). Ketteredge is also apparently a British name. There\'s no
clear reference for the Lockmore Hotel, but if you\'ll forgive the
curator for being mildly self-indulgent, my immediate thought for
\"something weird happening to a girl in a hotel presumably on the West
Coast\" was the various deaths in the Cecil Hotel\-- feel free to read
about those cases right
[here](https://allthatsinteresting.com/cecil-hotel-los-angeles), though
be warned that it involves discussion of death and specific suicide.

Lolo says to email her in order to ask about Laney Ketteredge, but as of
February 15^th^, 2022, she has not yet responded.
