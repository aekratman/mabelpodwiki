## All Seasons {#all_seasons}

Juniper is a member of the Underhill who fell in love with [Lily
Martin](Lily_Martin "Lily Martin"){.wikilink} when they were both
teenagers after hearing her singing.[^1] While Juniper loved Lily
dearly, she was not able to convince Lily to run away with her in order
to protect her from the wrath of [The
King](The_King "The King"){.wikilink} and [Luna
Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink}. Juniper left her after
explaining the exact way Lily would die, reminding her that when that
death occured, Lily would remember that Juniper had loved her enough to
attempt to save her.[^2]
