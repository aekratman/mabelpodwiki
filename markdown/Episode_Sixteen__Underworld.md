before solving three riddles and making it to Mabel. At this point, she

## Continuity

- Anna references the myth of Orpheus, confirming a direct parallel
  being written into her narrative.
- This is Anna and Mabel\'s first recorded interaction, and involves
  Mabel screaming Anna\'s name and Anna telling her it\'s alright. Very
  on-brand.
- As far as the author can remember, this is also the first time Anna
  directly tells Mabel she loves her.

## Trivia

`<small>`{=html}**Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.**`</small>`{=html}

- The third riddle uses **a**bsence, **n**ever, **n**eed, and **a**byss
  to spell out \'a-n-n-a\'; this is how many of the puzzle-box riddles
  are solved, by taking the first letter from a seemingly random string
  of words.
- Mabel saying \"please\" is strange, as she\'s usually anything but
  polite.
