## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

The episode opens with Aurora Silver monologuing at a fifteen-or-so
years younger Mabel about the process of purification, welcoming her to
El Segundo Academy, Mabel\'s boarding school in her teenage years. We
cut back to the present, where an incredibly freaked-out Mabel screams
at Anna about cutting herself apart to get Mabel back from the House\'s
jaws (see[
Matryoshka](Episode_Twenty-Eight:_Matryoshka " Matryoshka"){.wikilink}).

Veratrine starts being a jerk about it and Anna and her have a fight
highly reminiscent of twin sisters going at each other. Mabel cuts them
off, talking about how the House has trapped her for her entire life.
After they fight for a bit, the House starts making noises and Anna
moves away from the other two, Veratrine trying to convince Mabel to
trust her. Mabel refuses.

It doesn\'t work, and Veratrine mimics Anna\'s first line (\"I\'m going
into the ground for you\") before mocking Mabel as they follow Anna.
Anna finds a key in a broken mirror; Mabel threatens to murder
Veratrine, and they decide to go find the clock that the key belongs to.
The Unknown Voices continue Freaking The Hell Out, only being more
worried when they get a call from Aurora Silver. Anna opens the clock
and finds the owl pellets Mabel collected as a teenager, along with a
picture of Lily\'s old room. Once they head to Lily\'s room, they find a
datura seed pod. Anna tells Mabel she loves her.

They then find Mabel\'s childhood diary, which is horrifying as most of
Mabel\'s childhood was, and Mabel and Anna fight before Veratrine says
that Anna is a murderer; after a small bit more of arguing, Mabel
realizes her journal holds a nursery rhyme which becomes the key to the
whole affair. They realize that, since the King cannot back down from a
challenge, Anna needs to create a ritualistic challenge in order to
become a challenger to his throne for real.

## Continuity

- Mabel\'s journal is yet another example of exposition being handled by
  a Martin girl\'s old diary.
- The nursery rhyme is explored in more detail
  [here](Mabel's_Childhood_Spell "here"){.wikilink}.
- Vera calling Anna a murderer centers around Anna severing the
  connection between herself and Mabel while at college.
- [Tressa Davies](Tressa_Davies "Tressa Davies"){.wikilink} can be heard
  in the walls in this episode, three episodes before she properly
  arrives in
  [Tressa](Infinity_Mirror_Part_One:_Tressa "Tressa"){.wikilink}.

## Trivia

`<small>`{=html}**Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.**`</small>`{=html}

- This counts the third time Anna tells Mabel she loves her, and the
  first time she says it to her face rather than over voicemail. Mabel
  has a hard time understanding that people care about her, and thus is
  dumbstruck for a solid minute.
- The treasure hunt through the House is a well-used literary trope,
  especially in fairy tales.
- The picture used when this episode dropped is the painting [Perfect in
  Their
  Misery](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/foul-disfigurement/)
  by Arthur Rackham.
