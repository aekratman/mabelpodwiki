## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

This episode begins with Luna explaining how she met the King, when she
was kidnapped and transformed into the thing she now is. She says that
if Anna and Mabel think they could dethrone the King, then they should
do it. We then hear Mabel explaining the Court\'s dance/ball to Anna.
Vera mocks them for being sappy with each other.

Anna learns that Vera had offered herself as a bride to Mabel. Anna
chokes Vera out and forces Vera to explain her plan to infiltrate the
ball, which boils down to Vera passing as a member of the Court and
getting the other two inside; afterward, Anna and Mabel argue about Anna
dehumanizing Mabel.

We hear from the [unknown
voices](The_Unknown_Voices "unknown voices"){.wikilink} as they begin to
record the ball on their devices.

The girls reach the ball\'s entrance and Vera freaks out about how
powerful the King is. To pass the entrance, they solve a riddle (the
answer to this one being \"starling\"). Once inside, Anna hears a Court
member telling a man named
[Madrigal](Jack_Madrigal "Madrigal"){.wikilink} to play some music.
Anna, distracted by the man for an unknown reason, attempts to walk
towards Madrigal. Vera sees that Luna is kneeling next to the King in
submission and freaks out harder. The ball erupts into distortion and
the episode ends.\

    can\'t -
  - MABEL: Are you - alright -
