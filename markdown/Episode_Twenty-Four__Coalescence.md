## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

The longest episode of the entire show, *Coalescence* is the first
episode where Anna and Mabel are physically together on-script. The
essentials of this incredibly long and well-loved episode are as
follows:

- Mabel gives the House a piece of her arm in order to get back into the
  House after killing the doppleganger.
- Mabel originally believes that the Anna she meets is the doppleganger,
  and threatens to kill her.
- Anna convinces her she\'s real and they argue before Anna eventually
  shoves her against the wall, kissing her.
- They fight over which of them will return to the surface world, before
  the House threatens them and they run away.
- Anna asks Mabel how she got under the hill, and Mabel explains that
  she burnt down part of the House to get out. Anna and her fight about
  it.
- Anna gets mad at Mabel over villainizing herself.
- Anna says that she wants to be under the hill, and wants to be with
  Mabel.
- They kiss again.
- They fight over martyrdom.
- They decide to try to find a way out.
- They go to find the piece of Mabel\'s arm that she traded away in
  order to attempt to escape from the bargain she made with the House.
- They both discuss their fight.
- They find a door.
- While discussing what to do, they hear the King\-- repeating lines
  from Run, Rabbit, Run.
- Mabel tells Anna to run, and Anna refuses to leave her,
- Anna screams that if the House wants Mabel fair and square, it\'ll
  have to let them go.
- The House, following Anna\'s orders (because Anna is the owner of the
  estate), teleports them out.
- Mabel realizes that because Anna owns the estate, she has control over
  physicality and matter in the House. This also means she can control
  Mabel.
- Anna attempts to fix Mabel\'s arm, and is upset at Mabel because of
  how bad the injury is (because Mabel said the injury didn\'t matter,
  and Anna cares for Mabel very much).
- Anna tells the House to take them to where the piece of Mabel\'s arm
  is being kept.
- Mabel lights herself on fire in order to see in the room they are
  taken to.
- They find the piece of Mabel\'s arm.
  - ANNA: That's just. That's amazing. I was wondering where that
    *missing piece of your ulna went*, thank god you've kept it safe, I
    was starting to worry!
- They light the piece of her arm on fire, and Mabel starts screaming\--
  the piece, even though it sin\'t attached to her, still harms her.
- They decide to go through the cave they stand in front of.
- Anna\'s hand is lit on fire and turns into her fist of bone.
- Anna tells Mabel to leave again, realizing she truly is dead.
- Mabel asks Anna if she\'d like to kill the King.
- Anna agrees.

  monologue, which is the introduction for season four.

## Continuity

- This is the third time Mabel and Anna have met in person; the other
  two took place after
  [Freeze](Episode_Eight:_Freeze "Freeze"){.wikilink} and at the end of
  [Underworld](Episode_Sixteen:_Underworld "Underworld"){.wikilink}.
- Mabel counting herself the Bull in the Maze, which is what [episode
  twenty-three](Episode_Twenty-Three:_Bull_in_the_Maze "episode twenty-three"){.wikilink}
  was titled, leads to an interesting metaphor for Anna speaking to her.
