## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

After [Anna](Anna_Lim√≥n "Anna"){.wikilink} and
[Mabel](Mabel_Martin "Mabel"){.wikilink} discuss the upcoming coronation
and Anna confirms that she truly does want to take the throne,
[Luna](Luna_Thorne "Luna"){.wikilink} arrives to fill the \'priest\'
role in the coronation. We hear breifly from
[Janet](Janet_Kirk "Janet"){.wikilink}\-- who gets her tape recorder
stolen from her\-- and [Aconite](Aconite "Aconite"){.wikilink}\-- who is
panicking, repeating to herself over and over that it would \"all be
over soon.\"

Luna and Mabel argue and Mabel tells Anna that when the
[King](The_King "King"){.wikilink} threw the acorn in [Temporal
Snake](Episode_Thirty-Two:_Temporal_Snake "Temporal Snake"){.wikilink},
she was shown the entirety of his life; the girls go into the heart of
the Hill and Anna pledges herself to the throne, Mabel pledging herself
to *Anna* as her consort. Anna is upset because Mabel hadn\'t told her
she would be doing this, but they both promise that they\'ll always
choose each other.

Aconite rushes in just as Anna drops her blood into the Hill\'s heart to
finish the ceremony; she says that she has come to lay her claim and
that she has a right over Anna to the throne. The episode ends with the
entire Hill in an uproar.\
