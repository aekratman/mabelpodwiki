## Season Seven {#season_seven}

Kat\'s only canonical appearance is in [Episode Forty-Seven: What
Happened in the
\'20s](Episode_Forty-Seven:_What_Happened_in_the_'20s "Episode Forty-Seven: What Happened in the '20s"){.wikilink}.
She breaks into the Martin House with her friend
[Res](Res "Res"){.wikilink} and explores the place, finding a strange
painting that her and Res study. After she yells \"the door is going to
open!\", she and Res are presumably pulled into the Underhill.

## Trivia

- Kat\'s name means \"pure.\"
- She appears to enjoy The Queen of Spades by Alexander Pushkin\-- one
  of her reoccurring lines is \"three, seven, ace!\"
- She tends to be imaginative and loud; Res seems fondly resigned to
  chasing her around.
- When Res asks her to swear she\'s telling the truth, she swears on
  \"teddy\". The curator chooses to believe she\'s swearing on a stuffed
  animal.
