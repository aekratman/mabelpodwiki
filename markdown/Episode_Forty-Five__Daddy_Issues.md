## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

The episode begins with some very loud house noises before
[Anna](Anna_Limón "Anna"){.wikilink} speaks to
[Mabel](Mabel_Martin "Mabel"){.wikilink} on a phone she stole from
either [Lolo](Eidolon_García "Lolo"){.wikilink} or
[Janet](Janet_Kirk "Janet"){.wikilink}. She asks who stole her from her
world and took her from Mabel. We cut to the road trip trio, who have
been driving around. While they try to sit down, an
[Emissary](The_Emissary "Emissary"){.wikilink} who works for the King
comes to speak to them, revealing that Mabel is currently being trapped
by [the King of the Hill](The_King "the King of the Hill"){.wikilink}
who is trying to keep her safe.

The emissary discusses the webs of the world unraveling should Anna try
to get Mabel, and Anna says she doesn\'t care what happens to this
world. Lolo and Janet agree to help her, and the Emissary makes his exit
after saying that this world\'s Mabel was treated like a demon. Janet,
who knows the Rules, says that if they treat Mabel like a demon, the
road trip trio could attempt to summon her like one.

## Continuity

- Mabel is apparently once again trapped by the King of the Hill,
  bringing the cycle of events in her life all the way back around to
  season one.
- Anna asks \"Who is the author of all this?\" This can be read as a
  meta reference to her writer/voice actor, [Becca De La
  Rosa](Becca_De_La_Rosa "Becca De La Rosa"){.wikilink}\-- Anna is
  literally stuck in a trap of her own design, if we\'re going off
  [Infinity Mirror](Infinity_Mirror "Infinity Mirror"){.wikilink} rules.

## Trivia

`<small>`{=html}**Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.**`</small>`{=html}

- The description of this episode comes from a nursery rhyme: *"for want
  of a nail, the shoe was lost. / for want of a shoe, the horse was
  lost. / for want of a horse, the rider was lost / for want of a rider,
  the battle was lost / for want of a battle, the kingdom was lost, /
  and all for the want of a horseshoe nail."* It refers to a group only
  being as strong as their weakest link.
- The \"father\'s house\" is a church.
- Mabel has been referred to as a demon before; Sally at some point said
  that *she had the devil in her.*[^1]\
