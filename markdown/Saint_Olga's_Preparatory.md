Saint Olga\'s Preparatory was a \"cult school\" ran by [Aurora
Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}. Little is known about
the place besides that it was located in Massachusetts and was often
cold. Aurora Silver had some position of authority in the school and
eventually manipulated one of the students there, Ekaterina Roskova,
into becoming one of her subjects.
