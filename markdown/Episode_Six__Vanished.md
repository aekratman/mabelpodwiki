## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Anna tells Mabel about her uncle, who went missing in the hills. All
that was left of him was a wallet with 600 dollars\-- which Anna took to
be payment of some form\-- along with his shoes. They never found him,
leading Anna\'s mother to raise Anna and her sister with a dosage of
world-wariness that affected Anna into adulthood. She hears the doorbell
ring, but no one is there, so she goes to wake up Sally and finds her
missing.

She calls 911 and runs around the House, finding Sally in the garden
looking very, very dead. However, she\'s still alive, so Anna manages to
get her to a hospital. They won\'t let Anna stay overnight, so she goes
to leave, but Sally tells her "I tried to save her. Once I knew, I
tried, but it was too late. You believe me, don't you, Anna?"

Anna asks if she\'s talking about [Lily](Lily_Martin "Lily"){.wikilink},
and Sally says no. Anna, in a fit of desperation, asks if she was
talking about [Luna Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink}. Sally
says \"oh, Anna, I\'m so sorry,\" and the nurse makes Anna leave. Anna
ends the call by saying that Sally\'s safe in the hospital, that she\'ll
go there early tomorrow so Sally can tell her about Luna, then Anna will
tell Mabel and the spell will be broken. Everything will be okay.

Oh, Saint Anna, the author of this wiki wishes that were true. You\'ve
got a few dozen more episodes to go, honey.

- Anna calls Mabel the princess in the tower. Mabel, of course, is
  actually the monster of the story.
- Sally tried to *save* Luna\-- as Anna realizes later on in the show,
  you can\'t just save someone from hell. You\'ve got to love them for
  all that they are, even in the Underhill. Especially if they\'re a
  girl-half-burning.
