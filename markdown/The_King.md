The King is the primary \"antagonist\" in *Mabel.* He has no credited
voice actor, but one can assume his voice is a corrupted version of
Becca De La Rosa\'s.

## All Seasons {#all_seasons}

The King of the Underhill has been ruling for eons, his form shifting
and changing with the above-world seasons. He cares little for anything
or anyone save for [Mabel
Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink}; his most relevant
characterization comes from his caging of [Luna
Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink} after she betrays her
promise to him as his consort. He watches [Sally
Martin](Sally_Martin "Sally Martin"){.wikilink} die and allows Mabel and
[Anna Limón](Anna_Limón "Anna Limón"){.wikilink} to best him in a
challenge, losing his throne to Anna and disappearing. It has been
confirmed he will return in season seven.
