\
Mabel Martin is played by [Maybell
Marten](Maybell_Marten "Maybell Marten"){.wikilink}. She is one of the
two main protagonists of *Mabel*. Please be warned that this page
discusses heavy themes of abuse.

## Season One {#season_one}

Mabel does not appear in a large part of season one, but we do learn
several details about her life. Her father\'s name was
[Thomas](Thomas_Ortega "Thomas"){.wikilink}, and her mother\'s name was
[Lily](Lily_Martin "Lily"){.wikilink}; Thomas never got to meet Mabel,
and Lily died when she was four, leaving her to be raised by her
maternal grandparents. [Sally
Martin](Sally_Martin "Sally Martin"){.wikilink}, her grandmother, abused
her throughout her entire life. Mabel\'s only allies in her youth were
the Court, who she was able to communicate with, and the
[House](The_House "House"){.wikilink}, which cared about her more than
anything else. Mabel grew up \"half feral and half faeral,\"[^1] showing
a connection to Fairy Hill from a very young age. [Luna
Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink} lived in her mirror, and
while they were close when Mabel was a child, Luna and Mabel began to
fight after an incident in the garden of the Martin home, when Mabel was
bitten by a fox.[^2] She doesn\'t remember a large portion of her
childhood.

She was sent off to El Segundo Academy around the age of twelve and
placed in the care of one [Aurora
Silver](Aurora_Silver "Aurora Silver"){.wikilink}.[^3] She was
subsequently abused heavily once again\--though the details are not
revealed within the show\'s canon, the audience does learn Mabel was put
through a series of experiments, including being fed poison and
presumably being harmed with iron, to which she is incredibly allergic.
The tapes these experiments are recorded on refer to her as Subject
7825. At some unknown point, Mabel is captured and held captive in the
Underhill.

[Anna Limón](Anna_Limón "Anna Limón"){.wikilink} begins to call Mabel
around November of 2016[^4], and eventually drags herself into the
Underhill to get Mabel back. Mabel herself is heard from for the first
time in episode seven, where she continuously attempts to call Anna
back. At the end of season one, Anna goes into the Underworld and meets
Mabel physically for the first time.

## Season Two {#season_two}

Anna returns to the House, with Mabel trapped in the walls, only able to
properly communicate by making the lights buzz. Anna then decides to
drink poison, swapping herself and Mabel, with Anna now stuck in the
Underhill full-time.

In the last episode of season two, Anna solves a series of riddles and
manages to find her way back to Mabel, leaving Mabel in the house and
herself in the Underhill again.[^5]

## Season Three {#season_three}

Mabel is unused to the human world as a whole, and struggles with being
back. She\'s furious at Anna for both switching their places without
permission and for leaving her alone in the house that had trapped her
for so long; she alternates between screaming at Anna to leave her alone
and being terrified. She says that she isn\'t a person anymore and makes
several points that look towards her being some form of changeling,
though the creators of the podcast have confirmed that Mabel is many
things and cannot be defined simply by one term. It is revealed in the
first episode of this season that Mabel\'s voice actress is [Maybell
Marten](Maybell_Marten "Maybell Marten"){.wikilink}.[^6]

Mabel screams at Anna for trying to be the sacrificial lamb and/or a
self-loathing martyr. She begins to refer to the other woman as Saint
Anna and fights with one of Anna\'s friends when they call, worried
about her. She then breaks every mirror in the Martin home.

As she rages, Mabel tells Anna about Sally and Luna, and says that she
has no pity within her for either of them. Following Anna\'s journey in
[Pilgrimage](Episode_Eleven:_Pilgrimage "Pilgrimage"){.wikilink}, Mabel
attempts to visit the cemetery Sally is buried in in order to call
Anna\'s friend again, before realizing that she had never actually left
the House at all\--it has trapped her once again, pretending to be the
outside world. During this time, Mabel realizes the Court has replaced
Anna with a changeling double.[^7]

She gets to the garden and gives the House a piece of her arm in order
to keep herself bound to it, then finds a piece of her own hair in the
garden\--and with it, Anna\'s double. The double chases Mabel around and
attempts to get her to fall in love with her, thus abandoning Anna to
the Underhill. It does not work, and Mabel eventually climbs a tree
before dropping a match onto her. In the ensuing corrupted version of
hide-and-seek, Mabel manages to kill Anna\'s double by strangling
her.[^8]

Anna returns after Mabel gives a piece of her arm to the House and Mabel
almost kills *her*, thinking it\'s the double attempting to trick her
again. However, the two girls work it out and manage to finally kiss.
Then they fight about one of them having to leave. They hear the King\'s
voice and Anna orders the House to let them both out, revealing that
Anna is now the god of the place. Anna calls Mabel endless; then they go
get the piece of arm Mabel had torn off in order to get Anna back up to
the House. Anna\'s skin on her hand burns off and Mabel is half on fire
at all times.

They then decide the best course of action is to murder the king.[^9]\

## Season Four {#season_four}

The double, now calling herself
[Veratrine](Veratrine "Veratrine"){.wikilink}, comes back, and comes
with the girls as they attempt to challenge the King. After Anna fails
the first time, Mabel explains to her the Rules of the place after they
run back to the House. Mabel gets eaten by the House, and after Anna
gets her back by tearing herself open, they go on an adventure involving
Sally\'s old grandfather clock, Mabel\'s collection of owl pellets,
finding a drawing of Lily\'s bedroom, and Anna finally telling Mabel she
loves her. After Mabel stops being dumbstruck over that, they break into
Lily\'s room and find a datura seedling, which makes them believe the
cycle is starting once again. They then go on to find Mabel\'s childhood
diary, which allows them to understand that there needs to be a ritual
involved with challenging the king. Mabel gets Vera not to run away and
they head back to the Underhill, where they find Luna Thorne possessing
a faerie. Anna and Mabel have another fight when Mabel calls herself
more of a faerie than a human. Mabel gets really upset due to the fact
that she listens to literally everything Anna says with no way to stop;
she compares Anna to Sally. Anna then explains that she came to the
Martin house after she\'d \"cut the cord\" on the visions of another
girl she saw throughout college\--that girl, of course, being Mabel.

They make up and go challenge the King properly, Anna naming Mabel as
her champion. After they win, Anna fully frees Mabel of her bonds to
her, and tells Mabel she\'s free to leave if she wants to. She doesn\'t,
though, and they have a very nice scene before a boy named
[Brandon](Brandon "Brandon"){.wikilink} shows up where they\'re walking
and shoots himself in the head, the bullet ricocheting off and hitting
Mabel\'s arm.[^10]

## Season Six {#season_six}

Mabel screams at Anna not to touch her or the bullet wound. Anna gets
her to calm down by telling her secrets, and Mabel faints. After Anna
patches her up, they get put in the attic, where Mabel seems to have a
small flashback; she then tells Anna that the bullet had poisoned her
without saying anything else on the matter. They have a fight. Anna gets
Mabel to tell her why there are locusts in the attic\--as previously
mentioned, it\'s what Mabel ate when she was locked inside\--before
having another fight because Mabel misinterprets what Anna is saying.
The body of the dead boy comes back and a snake jumps out from it. Anna
drags a now-unconscious Mabel away. Anna solves more riddles to find
that Mabel is allergic to iron and that she needs to cut out every piece
of flesh the bullet touched in order for Mabel to heal.

Mabel wakes up and they go to Anna\'s coronation, where
[Aconite](Ekaterina_Roskova "Aconite"){.wikilink} challenges them for
the throne.[^11] Using a box of SD cards that the House had given Anna
(recorded torture sessions from Aurora Silver), they convince Aconite
that she\'s not the true heir to the throne, and Anna is crowned, naming
Mabel as her queen.

Anna is found at the end of the last episode of season six in the
\"real\" world again, with no sign whatsoever of Mabel.[^12]

## Season Seven {#season_seven}

In [Eidolon](Eidolon_García "Eidolon"){.wikilink} and
[Janet](Janet_Kirk "Janet"){.wikilink}\'s world where the seventh season
takes place, Mabel has been dead for years after being force-fed glass
by Sally Martin.[^13] We see Mabel in flashbacks, where she spends time
with Anna. They discover the King transformed into some form of shadow
monster in the Underhill; later, Anna reveals to Mabel that she\'d found
Sally\'s old diary. Anna tells Mabel that Sally made a deal with Luna
and tricked her in order to rebirth her brother
[Phillip](Phillip_Martin "Phillip"){.wikilink} in the form of her
daughter [Lily](Lily_Martin "Lily"){.wikilink}.[^14]

We learn more about Mabel\'s past from Eidolon and Janet\'s research.
Lolo has several redacted files from Mabel\' s past, and she tells Anna
about how this universe\'s Mabel died. When she was eleven, after the
force-feeding glass incident, Mabel was sent to live with a foster
family. Lily, who had been sent away to a behavior facility, returned to
the Martin House on a day that Mabel was there (for some unknown
reason). Lily left the House covered in Mabel\'s blood and promptly got
into a fatal car accident. They never found Mabel\'s actual body, but
the House was covered in her blood, and she was presumed dead.

Lolo and Janet take Anna to see Mabel\'s grave as, throughout the
narrative, we hear from our own version of Mabel. She gets into fights
with Lily\-- god knows where in the timeline THAT is\-- and has panic
attacks, screaming for her father (the King, presumably) to help her.
Back in Lolo\'s world, [The
Emissary](The_Emissary "The Emissary"){.wikilink} reveals to the road
trip trio that our version of Mabel has been taken back by the King, and
Lolo tells Anna that trying to get her back will result in the
destabilization of Eidolon and Janet\'s entire world. Anna does not
care.[^15]

In an attempt to get her back, the road trip trio go to the House and
attempt to pull off a summoning game in some way similar to the [Lesser
Banishing
Ritual.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_banishing_ritual_of_the_pentagram)
Janet is pulled into the walls of the House while trying to get Mabel
out\-- at the end, while Anna begs Mabel to wake up in her arms, only
Mabel\'s voice is heard, reciting
[Mabel?](Mabel? "Mabel?"){.wikilink}\'s lines from [A
Superfluity](Episode_Forty-One:_A_Superfluity "A Superfluity"){.wikilink}:
*I saw a thicket of trees break open like an  egg from a limpia. I saw a
girl walk into the dark woods with her mouth open  and her hand
outstretched towards the flaming sky. I saw a girl cut from herself  the
rib from which to make the world. I saw a girl thresh god out of her
belly.*[^16]

## Physical Description {#physical_description}

Mabel is an indigenous Mexican woman. She is short (not over 5\'3\" in
any universe[^17]) and thin. Her hair is long & dark, and her eyes are
green.[^18]

The creators of the show have specifically stated that they do not care
how Anna and Mabel are portrayed, so long as neither of them are
portrayed as white.[^19]
