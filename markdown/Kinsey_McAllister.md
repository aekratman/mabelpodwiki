## What Happened At El Segundo {#what_happened_at_el_segundo}

In the 2002-2003 school year, Kinsey was a freshman at El Segundo
Academy. She was one of the few that returned to the school after
Christmas break and was housed in Meredith dormitory along with all the
other 38 remaining students. Due to the four-to-a-room nature of the
Meredith dorm, fighting increased. Kinsey and fellow freshman [Laura
Jeung](Laura_Jeung "Laura Jeung"){.wikilink} \"got into a physical
altercation over an item of clothing\"; in punishment, their dorm
monitor decided to burn all of their personal belongings on the lawn of
the school. Kinsey attempted to get one of her stuffed animals from the
fire and ended up with third degree burns. She was treated at St.
Mark\'s Hospital and removed from El Segundo after the incident.
