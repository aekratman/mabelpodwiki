## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Anna goes looking for a book to find out what \"datura\" means after
seeing it in her dream in [episode
two](Episode_Two:_Really_Red "episode two"){.wikilink}. She finds an
encyclopedia with the page she needs carved out, instead finding an EP
record with \"hold with the hare\" written on it. She plays it and finds
a bead from a doll stuck on it, and when she goes to find the doll she
finds the page buried in the doll\'s skirt, overwritten in reddish ink
with a [riddle](The_First_Riddle "riddle"){.wikilink}.

Anna hangs up and comes back later, telling Mabel that her mother\'s
gotten sick but she doesn\'t want to talk about it, and that her mother
told her what \"hold with the hare\" means\-- it\'s from the saying *run
with the hounds, hold with the hare*, and is used to call someone a
hypocrite. She then recounts her dream, where a child version of Mabel
led her outside to show her the house overrun in vines and ivy.

## Continuity

- Seeing as the EP record presumably belongs to
  [Sally](Sally_Martin "Sally"){.wikilink}, we can assume
  [Luna](Luna_Thorne "Luna"){.wikilink} is the hare mentioned.
- This is the first in a series of riddles Anna has to solve.

## Trivia

`<small>`{=html}**Please note that this section contains spoilers for
later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.**`</small>`{=html}

- Luna\'s a hypocrite who broke her promise, which makes the hare
  metaphor a bit on the nose.
- All the mirrors in Anna\'s dreams are covered, meaning we\'re probably
  seeing the house as Mabel remembers it, rather than how Anna knows it.
- Anna reads Mabel a line from Richard the Third\-- \"and nothing can we
  call our own but death / and that small model of the barren earth /
  which serves as paste and cover to our bones.\" She quotes this again
  in episode 28, adding another line: \"for God's sake let us sit upon
  the ground / and tell sad stories of the death of kings.\"\
