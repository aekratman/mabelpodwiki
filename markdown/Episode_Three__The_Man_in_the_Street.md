## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Anna calls Mabel and tells her that there\'s a man outside the house,
leaning against the lamppost having a cigarette. She then explains that
[Sally](Sally_Martin "Sally"){.wikilink} is fine, just fell trying to
grab water from her nightstand at the end of the previous episode. Anna
found out the name on the letter\-- [Luna
Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink}, from a place called Fairy
Hill. The man comes up to Anna and asks her \"Hey, I\'m really sorry
about this, but I\'m so lost. Could you give me directions to
\[CENSORED\]?\" When she tells him, he just goes back to the lamppost.
He comes back about an hour later and asks the same question. Anna
threatens to call the cops, and says the man looked at her like she was
\"his [long-lost daughter](Mabel_Martin "long-lost daughter"){.wikilink}
that he\'d been trying to save for years.\" The third time he comes
back, he looks so utterly devastated that Anna forgets to call the cops
and tries to hug him. He pulls away from her and, looking at the house
behind her, mouths *get out* over and over. Then he leaves for real.

Anna ends the episode by telling Mabel the word in her dreams was
\"datura.\"

## Continuity

later episodes of Mabel. Continue at your own risk.`</small>`{=html}**

- The man was looking at Anna like a long-lost daughter because he was
  there looking for his actual daughter\-- he\'s
  [Thomas](Thomas "Thomas"){.wikilink}, and he wants to see
  [Mabel](Mabel_Martin "Mabel"){.wikilink}, who he never got to meet.
- The question Thomas asks Anna is presumably the same one he asked
  [Lily](Lily_Martin "Lily"){.wikilink} when he met her.

  creators, Anna is taller than Mabel, meaning it\'s canon that Mabel
  Martin is something like five feet tall.
- Anna cries when she\'s scared.
- This is the first episode that Anna states she\'s a lesbian
  (specifically, that she likes notebooks over boys).
