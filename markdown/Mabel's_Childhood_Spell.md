I know only what they tell me / in shades of sea and stone. / I sit with
hares, all unawares, / my kingdom for a bone. / The king of air who\'s
never there / sits on his throne of earth. / The king of lack all
dressed in black / is waiting for his birth.

## Speculation

![from Coraline (2002).](Hagstone.jpeg "from Coraline (2002).") This
focuses upon [The King](The_King "The King"){.wikilink}\'s cycle of life
and death through the seasons, with the king waiting for his \"birth\"
in the spring (seeing as this was written in the winter). That concept
is explored in [Bull in the
Maze](Episode_Twenty-Three:_Bull_in_the_Maze "Bull in the Maze"){.wikilink}.
\"Shades of sea and stone\" could refer to [adder / hag
stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_stone), which are rocks with
holes created by water in the center of them. In many places, they were
believed to be able to help you see beyond the veil, most famously in
modern media in *Coraline.* \"I sit with hares, all unawares\" is likely
referencing Mabel spending time with [Luna
Thorne](Luna_Thorne "Luna Thorne"){.wikilink}, the hare of the moon,
while \"my kingdom for a bone\" implies an unfair trade.
