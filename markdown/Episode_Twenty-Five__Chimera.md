## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

As various news reporters and podcasters throughout the county report on
Anna\'s mysterious disappearance, Anna and Mabel hide in a hidden bower
while several [unknown
voices](The_Unknown_Voices "unknown voices"){.wikilink} turn on their
recording microphones.

As Anna and Mabel argue in the bower, they receive a surprise visit from
Anna\'s doppleganger, who has brought herself back to life using mud and
twigs to fix her broken body. She tells Anna that Mabel killed her, and
Mabel\-- scared Anna no longer trusts her\-- tries to plead with Anna.
Anna cuts Mabel off and tells her that she knew about the murder
already, and tells the doppleganger to thank Mabel for giving her the
chance to forge herself before asking Mabel if she still needs Anna to
tell her that she trusts her. Mabel and Anna share a brief nice moment
before the doppleganger tells them that she\'s named herself
[Veratrine](Veratrine "Veratrine"){.wikilink}, after a poisonous flower.

Veratrine tells Anna and Mabel that the reason she came to speak to them
was to gain their help in overthrowing [the
King](the_King "the King"){.wikilink}, who she believes created her and
cursed her into life without gaining her permission. The last thing we
hear is the sound of the Court in revelry, which Veratrine and Mabel
explain to Anna is the King\'s ball/party.
