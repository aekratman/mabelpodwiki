\
Aurora Silver is played by Meg Dixon. She is a primary antagonist of the
later seasons of *Mabel.* Please be warned that this page discusses
abuse and suicide.

## Season Four {#season_four}

Aurora was introduced under the words of her workers, [The Unknown
Voices](The_Unknown_Voices "The Unknown Voices"){.wikilink}, who were
attempting to record the [King](The_King "King"){.wikilink}\'s voice.
[Brandon](Brandon "Brandon"){.wikilink} refers to her as a
\'boogeyman\', and Jonathan tells a story about being recruited into the
cult, Aurora eventually killing his bully and saving his life. He
stresses that Aurora Silver made the murder disappear and that \"no
rules apply to her.\"[^1]

We eventually learn that Aurora Silver was an authority figure to [Mabel
Martin](Mabel_Martin "Mabel Martin"){.wikilink} during her time at [El
Segundo Academy](El_Segundo_Academy "El Segundo Academy"){.wikilink}.
She promised her that the \"process of purification\" that she was going
to put Mabel through would not be easy.[^2]

Her overall goal seems to be capturing the King, as is said in [The King
Speaks](Episode_Thirty-One:_The_King_Speaks "The King Speaks"){.wikilink}:
\"You have fought, and slaughtered, and worried, and scrabbled, and
campaigned, and lied, and eaten bitter meals, only to find me. To
catalogue me in your book\... Would it not be the end of you, Aurora
Silver, for me to say: you will never find me, you will never catch me,
there will be no trace of me left for you to hold?\" She inflicted the
King onto her [subjects](The_Subjects "subjects"){.wikilink}, including
Mabel (Subject 7825) and [Ekaterina
Roskova](Ekaterina_Roskova "Ekaterina Roskova"){.wikilink} (Subject
6163). It resulted in pain or death for all of them; when [The
House](The_House "The House"){.wikilink} gives Mabel\'s subject tape
recordings back to her, Mabel panics immediately.

While the girls attempt to take down the King, Jonathan accidently loses
the recording of the King\'s voice they managed to get. In retribution,
Aurora Silver sends Brandon down to the Hill and (presumably) tells him
to shoot himself in front of Anna and Mabel after saying \"I\'m going
into the ground for you.\" This results in Mabel being poisoned during
most of season six.

## Season Five {#season_five}

During [Infinity Mirror](Infinity_Mirror "Infinity Mirror"){.wikilink},
Aurora Silver is a background villain. [Tressa
Davies](Tressa_Davies "Tressa Davies"){.wikilink}, the season\'s
protagonist, is a former cultist, inducted in elementary school at [Lang
Primary Conservatory for the
Disabled](Lang_Primary_Conservatory_for_the_Disabled "Lang Primary Conservatory for the Disabled"){.wikilink}.
Aurora Silver\-- under the alias of Lara Ouvriers (literally an anagram
of Aurora Silver), the school\'s principal\-- eventually killed a boy
called [The Mourning
Dove](The_Mourning_Dove "The Mourning Dove"){.wikilink} in front of
Tressa, causing the girl a severe amount of trauma. After admitting to
her complacency in the cult, Tressa reverses time in order to save the
Dove\'s life.

## Season Six {#season_six}

Season six is what reveals Mabel\'s position as a former subject.[^3]
Through the season, we hear her on several subject tapes. It is also
revealed during this season that the torture she inflicted on Ekaterina
Roskova led to her amnesia and descent to the Hill to become
[Aconite](Aconite "Aconite"){.wikilink} after accidentally summoning a
god during a cult torture session.

## Season Seven {#season_seven}

Aurora is the first voice we hear in season seven after Mabel\'s
voicemail, speaking to a presumed cultist named
[Violette](Violette "Violette"){.wikilink}. She has recordings of the
King that Jonathan found, and believes them to be a message.[^4] We also
hear that she is becoming \"erratic\" and making mistakes during
Jonathan\'s contingency plan monologue where he calls her a kind of
political extremist and betrays his loyalty to her.[^5] We also hear
about the boarding school she presumably ran burning down when Janet
brings up [What Happened At El
Segundo](What_Happened_At_El_Segundo "What Happened At El Segundo"){.wikilink}.[^6]

## Trivia

- Aurora canonically dislikes cats.
- She also enjoys eating \"spiny fish containing exactly ten
  calories.\"[^7]
