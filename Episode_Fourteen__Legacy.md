## Episode Overview {#episode_overview}

[Anna](Anna_Lim√≥n "Anna"){.wikilink} makes one last desperate play.

#### **Trigger Warnings** {#trigger_warnings}

- Suicide, death, animal death, loud noise.

## Episode Summary {#episode_summary}

Anna learns Sally has left her her house and an inheritance; it is paid
to Anna like her wages were, essentially indenturing Anna to the house.
Anna then finds a strange book that has a recipe for opening doors, as
[Thomas](Thomas "Thomas"){.wikilink} mentioned in the previous episode.
Despite it being literal poison, Anna drinks it after a frankly
spectacular monologue. The episode ends with her body falling to the
floor.
